abstract = {In an important model for neuroscience, songbirds learn to discriminate songs they hear during tape-recorded playbacks, as demonstrated by song-specific habituation of both behavioral and neurogenomic responses in the auditory forebrain. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) may participate in the changing pattern of gene expression induced by song exposure. To test this, we used massively parallel Illumina sequencing to analyse small RNAs from auditory forebrain of adult zebra finches exposed to tape-recorded birdsong or silence.},

@article{Mello1994,
abstract = {The ZENK gene encodes a zinc-finger-containing transcriptional regulator and can be rapidly activated in songbird brain by presentation of birdsong (Mello et al., 1992). Here we map the areas of the songbird forebrain that show this genomic response to birdsong, using in situ hybridization. After 30 min of song presentation ZENK mRNA levels reach a peak in the caudomedial telencephalon, in areas adjacent to or closely related with primary auditory structures. These areas include subfields of field L (L1 and L3), the caudomedial neostriatum (NCM), the caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale (CMHV) anterior to field L, the caudal paleostriatum, and two field L targets, HVC shelf and RA cup. In contrast, ZENK induction is absent in some areas that show a response to song by other measures and where ZENK induction might have been expected. These include the direct thalamo-recipient field L subfield L2, and the nuclei of the circuit involved in the acquisition and production of learned song. These results demonstrate that ZENK induction following song presentation occurs only in a subset of areas physiologically activated by song, and draw attention to areas previously unsuspected as related to processing of complex auditory stimuli. Based on what is known about ZENK function in mammalian systems (Christy et al., 1989; Cole et al., 1989; Wisden et al., 1990), we speculate that areas revealed by ZENK induction might correspond to sites where critical neuronal modifications occur in response to birdsong presentation, possibly leading to the formation of song-related memories.},

abstract = {Phenology refers to the periodic appearance of life-cycle events and currently receives abundant attention as the effects of global change on phenology are so apparent. Phenology as a discipline observes these events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing programmes (e.g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists and need to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change impacts on phenology.},

@article{Glykys2006,
abstract = {Functionally, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAR)-mediated inhibition can be classified as phasic (synaptic) and tonic (extrasynaptic). The GABARs underlying tonic inhibition assemble from subunits different from those responsible for phasic inhibition. We wanted to assess the excitability of hippocampal pyramidal cell (PC) networks following a selective impairment of tonic inhibition. This is difficult to accomplish by pharmacological means. Because the GABAR alpha5 subunits mostly mediate the tonic inhibition in CA1 and CA3 PCs, we quantified changes in tonic inhibition and examined network excitability in slices of adult gabra5-/- mice. In gabra5-/- CA1 and CA3 PCs tonic inhibitory currents were 60 and 53{\%}, respectively, of those recorded in wild type (WT), with no alterations in phasic inhibition. The amount of tonic inhibition recorded in slices was significantly affected by the method of slice storage (interface or submerged chamber). Field recordings in gabra5-/- CA3 pyramidal layer showed an increased network excitability that was decreased by the GABAR agonist muscimol at a concentration that restored the tonic inhibition of gabra5-/- PCs to the WT level without altering phasic inhibition. Through a battery of pharmacological experiments, we have identified delta subunit-containing GABARs as the mediators of the residual tonic inhibition in gabra5-/- PCs. Our study is consistent with an important role of tonic inhibition in the control of hippocampal network excitability and highlights selective enhancers of tonic inhibition as promising therapeutic approaches for diseases involving network hyperexcitability.},

abstract = {Consonant and dissonant pitch relationships in music provide the foundation of melody and harmony, the building blocks of Western tonal music. We hypothesized that phase-locked neural activity within the brainstem may preserve information relevant to these important perceptual attributes of music. To this end, we measured brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) from nonmusicians in response to the dichotic presentation of nine musical intervals that varied in their degree of consonance and dissonance. Neural pitch salience was computed for each response using temporally based autocorrelation and harmonic pitch sieve analyses. Brainstem responses to consonant intervals were more robust and yielded stronger pitch salience than those to dissonant intervals. In addition, the ordering of neural pitch salience across musical intervals followed the hierarchical arrangement of pitch stipulated by Western music theory. Finally, pitch salience derived from neural data showed high correspondence with behavioral consonance judgments (r = 0.81). These results suggest that brainstem neural mechanisms mediating pitch processing show preferential encoding of consonant musical relationships and, furthermore, preserve the hierarchical pitch relationships found in music, even for individuals without formal musical training. We infer that the basic pitch relationships governing music may be rooted in low-level sensory processing and that an encoding scheme that favors consonant pitch relationships may be one reason why such intervals are preferred behaviorally.},

abstract = {The efficient-coding hypothesis asserts that neural and perceptual sensitivity evolved to faithfully represent biologically relevant sensory signals. Here we characterized the spectrotemporal modulation statistics of several natural sound ensembles and examined how neurons encode these statistics in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC) of cats. We report that modulation-tuning in the CNIC is matched to equalize the modulation power of natural sounds. Specifically, natural sounds exhibited a tradeoff between spectral and temporal modulations, which manifests as 1/f modulation power spectrum (MPS). Neural tuning was highly overlapped with the natural sound MPS and neurons approximated proportional resolution filters where modulation bandwidths scaled with characteristic modulation frequencies, a behavior previously described in human psychoacoustics. We demonstrate that this neural scaling opposes the 1/f scaling of natural sounds and enhances the natural sound representation by equalizing their MPS. Modulation tuning in the CNIC may thus have evolved to represent natural sound modulations in a manner consistent with efficiency principles and the resulting characteristics likely underlie perceptual resolution.},

abstract = {To date, the neurophysiological model has been used to explain the complexity of tinnitus. However from now on, the tinnitus dopaminergic pathway opens new horizons for ear noises management. Tinnitus perception takes place in prefrontal, primary temporal and temporo-parietal associative areas, as well as the limbic system. Dopaminergic neurotransmitters go through prefrontal, primary temporal, temporo-parietal associative areas and the limbic system. Tinnitus perception and dopaminergic pathway share the same cerebral structures, which control attention, stress, emotions, learning, memory and motivated behavior. Distress of tinnitus emanates from these same cerebral functions. The dopaminergic pathway can be modulated by agonists and antagonists of their receptors and can reduce the perception of tinnitus, such as sulpiride, amisulpride, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, zuclopenthixole and aripiprazole, still under investigation, that together with sound treatment as the Sequential Sound Therapy, and a personal contact with the patient, constitute a tinnitus integral treatment.},

abstract = {The perception of song is vital to the reproductive success of both male and female songbirds. Several neural structures underlying this perception have been identified by examining expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) following the presentation of conspecific or heterospecific song. In the few avian species investigated, areas outside of the circuit for song production contain neurons that are active following song presentation, specifically the caudal hyperstriatum ventrale (cHV) and caudomedial neostriatum (NCM). While studied in detail in the male zebra finch, IEG responses in these neural substrates involved in song perception have not been quantified in females. Therefore, adult female zebra finches were presented with zebra finch song, nonzebra finch song, randomly generated tones, or silence for 30 min. One hour later they were sacrificed, and their brains removed, sectioned, and immunocytochemically processed for FOS expression. Animals exposed to zebra finch song had a significantly higher density of FOS-immunoreactive cells in the NCM than those presented with other songs, tones, or silence. Neuronal activation in the cHV was equivalent in birds that heard zebra finch and non-zebra finch song, expression that was higher than that observed in the groups that heard no song. Interestingly, the hippocampus (HP) and adjacent parahippocampal area (AHP) were activated in a manner comparable to the NCM. These results suggest a general role for the cHV in song perception and a more specific role for the NCM and HP/AHP in facilitating recognition of and responsiveness to species-specific song in female zebra finches.},

abstract = {Neuronal orientation selectivity has been shown in animal models to require corticocortical network cooperation and to be dependent on the presence of GABAergic inhibition. However, it is not known whether variability in these fundamental neurophysiological parameters leads to variability in behavioral performance. Here, using a combination of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetoencephalography, and visual psychophysics, we show that individual performance on a visual orientation discrimination task is correlated with both the resting concentration of GABA and the frequency of stimulus-induced gamma oscillations in human visual cortex. Behaviorally, a strong oblique effect was found, with the mean angular threshold for oblique discrimination being five times higher than that for vertically oriented stimuli. Similarly, we found an oblique effect for the dependency of performance on neurophysiological parameters. Orientation detection thresholds were significantly negatively correlated with visual cortex GABA concentration for obliquely oriented patterns (r = -0.65, p {\textless} 0.015) but did not reach significance for vertically oriented stimuli (r = -0.39, p = 0.2). Similarly, thresholds for obliquely oriented stimuli were negatively correlated with gamma oscillation frequency (r = -0.65, p {\textless} 0.017), but thresholds for vertical orientations were not (r = -0.02, p = 0.9). Gamma oscillation frequency was positively correlated with GABA concentration in primary visual cortex (r = 0.67, p {\textless} 0.013). These results confirm the importance of GABAergic inhibition in orientation selectivity and demonstrate, for the first time, that interindividual performance on a simple visual task is linked to neurotransmitter concentration. The results also suggest a key role for GABAergic gamma oscillations in visual discrimination tasks.},

abstract = {Does the cerebellum influence nonmotor behavior? Recent anatomical studies demonstrate that the output of the cerebellum targets multiple nonmotor areas in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex, as well as the cortical motor areas. The projections to different cortical areas originate from distinct output channels within the cerebellar nuclei. The cerebral cortical area that is the main target of each output channel is a major source of input to the channel. Thus, a closed-loop circuit represents the major architectural unit of cerebro-cerebellar interactions. The outputs of these loops provide the cerebellum with the anatomical substrate to influence the control of movement and cognition. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data supply compelling support for this view. The range of tasks associated with cerebellar activation is remarkable and includes tasks designed to assess attention, executive control, language, working memory, learning, pain, emotion, and addiction. These data, along with the revelations about cerebro-cerebellar circuitry, provide a new framework for exploring the contribution of the cerebellum to diverse aspects of behavior.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), a free gaseous signaling molecule, is involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular, nervous and immune system. The neurotransmitter function of nitric oxide is dependent on dynamic regulation of its biosynthetic enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS). There are three types of NOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Of the three NOS, we focus on nNOS in the present review. Brain nNOS exists in particulate and soluble forms and the differential subcellular localization of nNOS may contribute to its diverse functions. Proteins bearing PDZ domains can interact directly with the PDZ domain of nNOS, influencing the subcellular distribution and/or activity of the enzyme. During the past several years, an increasing number of reports have demonstrated the importance of nNOS in a variety of synaptic signaling events. nNOS has been implicated in modulating physiological functions such as learning, memory, and neurogenesis, as well as being involved in a number of human diseases. In this review we concentrate on recent findings regarding the structural features, subcellular localization and factors regulating nNOS function. In particular, we conclude with a section discussing the role of nNOS in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Recent evidence showed that exposure of tape-tutored zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis) males to the tutor song involves neuronal activation in brain regions outside the conventional 'song control pathways', particularly the caudal part of the neostriatum (NCM) and of the hyperstriatum ventrale (CMHV). Zebra finch males were reared with a live tutor during the sensitive period for song learning. When, as adults, they were re-exposed to the tutor song, the males showed increased expression of Fos, the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos, in the NCM and CMHV, compared with expression in two conventional 'song control nuclei', high vocal centre (HVC) and Area X. The strength of the Fos response (which is a reflection of neuronal activation) in the NCM (but not in the other three regions) correlated significantly and positively with the number of song elements that the birds had copied from the tutor song. Thus, socially tutored zebra finch males show localized neural activation in response to tutor song exposure, which correlates with the strength of song learning.},

What happens to the retinotopic map in primary visual cortex (V1) during the perception of these size illusions? Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), that the retinotopic representation of an object changes in accordance with its perceived angular size. A distant object that appears to occupy a larger portion of the visual field activates a larger area in V1 than an object of equal angular size that is perceived to be closer and smaller. These results demonstrate that the retinal size of an object and the depth information in a scene are combined early in the human visual system.},

abstract = {The distribution of serotonin immunoreactivity in the cat cerebellum was studied by using the indirect antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique. Furthermore, the origin of these chemically defined afferents was determined by combining the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with the PAP technique. In the cerebellar cortex, serotonin immunoreactivity is present in a plexus of beaded fibers that is confined almost exclusively to the granule and Purkinje cell layers; a few fibers are present in the molecular layer. Serotoninergic axons and varicosities have a dense and uniform distribution throughout all lobules of the cerebellum with the exception of lobule X where the fiber density is sparse. Serotonin cell bodies were not found within the cerebellar cortex. However, following pretreatment with pargyline and L-tryptophan, serotonin positive cell bodies were found in all deep cerebellar nuclei as well as the raphe and reticular nuclei in the brainstem. The present study demonstrates that the serotoninergic projection to the cat's cerebellum has some degree of topographical organization. Serotoninergic fibers in the anterior vermis (lobules I-V) were shown to arise from neurons located within the paramedian reticular nucleus, the lateral reticular nucleus, and the lateral tegmental field. Injections of HRP into either the posterior vermis (lobule VI-IX) or the paramedian lobule, labeled serotoninergic neurons exclusively in the lateral reticular nucleus. Lobus simplex, crus I and crus II (the hemisphere) receive a serotoninergic input from cells located in the lateral tegmental field, the peri-olivary reticular formation and the paramedian reticular nucleus. In no cases were neurons in the raphe double-labeled, although there were cells positive for HRP or serotonin alone. The data indicate that there is a topographical organization in the serotoninergic projection from the caudal brainstem to specific regions of the cat's cerebellar cortex. In addition to climbing and mossy fibers, this projection represents a third major source of cerebellar afferents based on its dense and widespread distribution as well as its morphological and chemical characteristics.},

abstract = {The basal ganglia and cerebellum are major subcortical structures that influence not only movement, but putatively also cognition and affect. Both structures receive input from and send output to the cerebral cortex. Thus, the basal ganglia and cerebellum form multisynaptic loops with the cerebral cortex. Basal ganglia and cerebellar loops have been assumed to be anatomically separate and to perform distinct functional operations. We investigated whether there is any direct route for basal ganglia output to influence cerebellar function that is independent of the cerebral cortex. We injected rabies virus (RV) into selected regions of the cerebellar cortex in cebus monkeys and used retrograde transneuronal transport of the virus to determine the origin of multisynaptic inputs to the injection sites. We found that the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia has a substantial disynaptic projection to the cerebellar cortex. This pathway provides a means for both normal and abnormal signals from the basal ganglia to influence cerebellar function. We previously showed that the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum has a disynaptic projection to an input stage of basal ganglia processing, the striatum. Taken together these results provide the anatomical substrate for substantial two-way communication between the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Thus, the two subcortical structures may be linked together to form an integrated functional network.},

abstract = {We studied flying zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata, N = 12), to provide a new test of a long-standing ;fixed-gear' hypothesis that flap-bounding birds use only intermittent non-flapping phases, instead of variation in muscle activity, to vary mechanical power output in flight. Using sonomicrometry and electromyography, we measured in vivo fascicle length and neuromuscular recruitment in the pectoralis as the birds flew in different flight modes (level, ascending, descending; mean velocity 1.6+/-0.3 m s(-1)) and across velocities in a new, variable-speed wind tunnel (0-12 m s(-1)). Synchronized high-speed digital video (250 Hz) provided a record of wing kinematics. Flight mode had a significant effect upon pectoralis strain, strain rate, fractional shortening and the relative timing of muscle activity (onset, offset and duration). Among flight velocities, we observed significant variation in pectoralis strain, fractional lengthening and shortening, strain rate, relative electromyographic (EMG) amplitude, and EMG duration and offset. In particular, variation in strain rate and relative EMG amplitude indicates that the fixed-gear hypothesis should be rejected. Instead, it appears that zebra finch vary work and power output within wingbeats by modulating muscle contractile behavior and between wingbeats using intermittent bounds. Muscle activity patterns and wing kinematics were similar between free flight and wind tunnel flight at similar speeds. Comparing flights with and without surgically implanted transducers and electrodes, zebra finch exhibited a reduction in maximum velocity (from 14 to 12 m s(-1)) and a significant increase in wingbeat frequency and percent time flapping. This identifies a potential limitation of in vivo flight measurements, and similar studies of bird flight should, therefore, include measurements of the extent to which flight performance is compromised by experimental protocol.},

abstract = {In speciation events, species-distinct vocal signals can diverge acoustically in many ways. Signal receivers have to be able to distinguish conspecific from allospecific vocalizations, and the perceptual salience of acoustic features is therefore expected to be an important factor in the evolution of such vocalizations. We tested how dissimilar the species-identifying perch-coos of 12 closely related turtle-dove species (genus Streptopelia) are, as perceived by one of its members, S. roseogrisea. With operant, psychoacoustic methods we trained six doves to respond only to their conspecific coo. Responses to the perch-coos of the 12 other dove species were used as a measure of their perceptual similarity to conspecific perch-coos. Turtle-doves differentiated between the allospecific coos: some were perceived as more similar to their own species' coo than others. With multiple regression analysis we identified three acoustic features that correlated with these differences in perceptual similarity: coo duration, minimum frequency and Wiener entropy. In contrast to findings in other bird species, duration was by far the most important feature in the discrimination between conspecific and allospecific vocalizations for S. roseogrisea. The results suggest that this is due not only to the coos of the various species differing in duration but also to a comparatively high perceptibility of the differences in duration. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

abstract = {About 10{\%} of autistic individuals exhibit some form of islets of abilities in the face of serious intellectual or mental disability ("savant syndrome"). The aim of this study was to investigate brain mechanisms in a sample of autistic subjects with outstanding memory. We investigated seven mnemonist savants with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and seven matched controls with 151-channel whole-head magnetencephalography in a continuous old-new paradigm. They were presented with 300 pseudowords and 300 shapes and had to indicate by button press, whether the presented stimulus had been shown before. Unexpectedly, mnemonist savants did not perform better than controls, but were outperformed in the recognition of pseudowords. Accordingly, event-related magnetic fields elicited by pseudowords showed widespread old-new effects in controls, but not in savants. A source analysis of its early components revealed right occipital activation in savants, but left parietal activation in controls. This might be related to a visual processing style in mnemonist savants that proved to be inefficient in this task. During the possibly familiarity-based recognition of shapes, there were earlier and more widespread bilateral old-new effects in mnemonist savants, what might reflect their experience with figural material. In a neuropsychological test battery, mnemonist savants performed comparably to autistic people without special memory skills. However, a different factor structure of these tests pointed to a different organization of memory in mnemonist savants compared to controls that is characterized by its relative independence of general intelligence.},

This diversity encompasses traits like vocal communication and complex social behaviors that are of great interest to humans, but that are not well represented in other accessible research organisms. Many songbirds are readily observable in nature and thus afford unique insight into the links between environment and organism. The distinctive organization of the songbird brain will facilitate analysis of genomic links to brain and behavior. Access to the zebra finch genome sequence will, therefore, prompt new questions and provide the ability to answer those questions.},

In model studies, such spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) introduces the desirable features of competition among synapses and regulation of postsynaptic firing characteristics. STDP strengthens synapses that receive correlated input, which can lead to the formation of stimulus-selective columns and the development, refinement, and maintenance of selectivity maps in network models. The temporal asymmetry of STDP suppresses strong destabilizing self-excitatory loops and allows a group of neurons that become selective early in development to direct other neurons to become similarly selective. STDP, acting alone without further hypothetical global constraints or additional forms of plasticity, can also reproduce the remapping seen in adult cortex following afferent lesions.},

The frequency with which musical events occurred in different temporal locations differentiates one meter from another and coincides with music-theoretic predictions of accent placement. Goodness-of-fit judgments for events presented in metrical contexts indicated a multileveled hierarchy of relative accent strength, with finer differentiation among hierarchical levels by musically experienced than inexperienced listeners. Memory confusions of temporal patterns in a discrimination task were characterized by the same hierarchy of inferred accent strength. These findings suggest mental representations for structural regularities underlying musical meter that influence perceiving, remembering, and composing music.},

abstract = {As an important animal model to study the relationship between behaviour and neural activity, the mouse is able to perform a variety of visual tasks, such as orientation discrimination and contrast detection. However, it is not clear how stimulus contrast influences the performance of orientation discrimination in mice. In this study, we used two task designs, two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) and go/no-go, to examine the performance of mice to discriminate two orthogonal orientations at different contrasts. We found that the performance tended to increase with contrast, and the performance at high contrast was better when the stimulus set contained a single contrast than multiple contrasts. Physiological experiments in V1 showed that neural discriminability of two orthogonal orientations increased with contrast. Furthermore, orientation discriminability of V1 neurons at high contrast was higher in the single than in the multiple contrast condition, largely due to smaller response variance in the single contrast condition. Thus, the performance of mice to discriminate orientations at high contrast is adapted to the contrast range in the stimuli, partly attributed to the contrast-range dependent capacity of V1 neurons to discriminate orientations.},

Whereas most research has focussed on receiver biases in the sensory system, more recent studies show that biases can also arise from learning about signals. Here, we highlight how learning-based biases can arise, and how these differ from biases emerging from sensory systems in their impact on signal evolution.},

Zebrin II is expressed by subsets of Purkinje cells that form an array of parasagittal bands that extend rostrocaudally throughout the cerebellar cortex, separated by similar bands of Purkinje cells that do not express zebrin II. Recent cloning studies have revealed that the zebrin II antigen is the respiratory isoenzyme aldolase C. This article reviews the cellular and molecular compartmentation of the cerebellum together with the molecular biology of the aldolase C gene, and speculates on possible reasons for a striped pattern of expression.},

abstract = {The strength of the connection between two neurons can be modified by activity, in a way that depends on the timing of neuronal firing on either side of the synapse. This spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has been studied by systematically varying the intervals between pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Here we studied how STDP operates in the context of more natural spike trains. We found that in visual cortical slices the contribution of each pre-/postsynaptic spike pair to synaptic modification depends not only on the interval between the pair, but also on the timing of preceding spikes. The efficacy of each spike in synaptic modification was suppressed by the preceding spike in the same neuron, occurring within several tens of milliseconds. The direction and magnitude of synaptic modifications induced by spike patterns recorded in vivo in response to natural visual stimuli were well predicted by incorporating the suppressive inter-spike interaction within each neuron. Thus, activity-induced synaptic modification depends not only on the relative spike timing between the neurons, but also on the spiking pattern within each neuron. For natural spike trains, the timing of the first spike in each burst is dominant in synaptic modification.},

@article{Frontali1974,
abstract = {Previous work with rats showed slower active avoidance (AA) and passive avoidance (PA) learning in a light-go/noise-light no-go task (L +NL -) than in a noise-go/light-noise no-go task (N +LN -), independently of noise intensity and of presence or absence of AA pretraining. Experiment I compared these two tasks and the corresponding discriminations with a compound AA and a simple PA signal. The latter were learned at a faster rate, with only negligible differences between the two types of stimulus arrangements (NL +L - vs LN +N -). Experiment II investigated the acquisition and reversal of four go/no-go tasks with a simple AA signal, with either a simple or a compound no-go signal and asymmetrical reinforcement, i.e., with an extinction instead of a PA contingency during the presentation of no-go signals. As in previous experiments with symmetrical reinforcement, the groups with a simple no-go signal (L +N -, N +L -) acquired AA with little or no generalization to the other stimulus. In reversal, however, the L +N - group (formerly N +L -) responded to the no-go signal much more frequently than the other (N +L -, formerly L +N -). Both the L +NL - and the N +LN - groups gave a large number of responses to the extinction signal, but the differences between the two groups were at least as large as in previous work with a PA contingency. These data show that perceptual or attentional phenomena cannot explain stimulus nonequivalences in situations with a compound no-go signal. Furthermore, the similar nonequivalences found in situations with and without differential fear conditioning (AA-extinction tests vs AA-PA tests) leads to complex, highly speculative models concerning possible interactions between response and drive-modulating properties of various stimuli. {\textcopyright} 1974 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Interval timing in the seconds-to-minutes range is crucial to learning, memory, and decision-making. Recent findings argue for the involvement of cortico-striatal circuits that are optimized by the dopaminergic modulation of oscillatory activity and lateral connectivity at the level of cortico-striatal inputs. Striatal medium spiny neurons are proposed to detect the coincident activity of specific beat patterns of cortical oscillations, thereby permitting the discrimination of supra-second durations based upon the reoccurring patterns of subsecond neural firing. This proposal for the cortico-striatal representation of time is consistent with the observed psychophysical properties of interval timing (e.g. linear time scale and scalar variance) as well as much of the available pharmacological, lesion, patient, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging data from animals and humans (e.g. dopamine-related timing deficits in Huntington's and Parkinson's disease as well as related animal models). The conclusion is that although the striatum serves as a 'core timer', it is part of a distributed timing system involving the coordination of large-scale oscillatory networks.},

would restore rhythmicity in the singing behaviour of arrhythmic male

indicator, monitored the activity-rest pattern in male zebra finches
(Taeniopygia guttata) housed without or with a conspecific female under
12 h light: 12 h darkness (12L:12D) or constant bright light (LLbright).
Both unpaired and paired birds exhibited a significant daily rhythm in
the singing and activity behaviour, but paired birds, under 12L:12D,
showed a similar to 2 h extension in the evening. Exposure to LLbright
decayed rhythmicity, but the female presence restored rhythmic patterns
without affecting the 24 h song output. In the acoustic features, we
found a significant difference in the motif duration between unpaired
and paired male songs. Overall, these results demonstrated for the first
time the role of the female in restoring the circadian phenotype of
singing behaviour in male songbirds with disrupted circadian functions,
although how interaction between sexes affects the circadian timing of
male singing is not understood yet. It is suggested that social cues
rendered by a conspecific female could improve the circadian performance
by restoring rhythmicity in the biological functions of the cohabiting

abstract = {Song acquisition in songbird males is a prominent model system for the study of the brain mechanisms of memory. Male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) learn their songs from an adult conspecific tutor early in life. Previous work has shown that exposure of males to their tutor song leads to increased expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and in the caudomedial mesopallium (CMM). In addition, IEG expression in the NCM correlates significantly with the strength of song learning. Interpretation of these findings is complicated, as males both learn the characteristics of tutor song and learn to produce a similar own song. Female zebra finches do not sing, but nevertheless they learn the characteristics of a song to which they were exposed when young, and form a preference for it. Here, adult zebra finch females reared with their fathers showed a significant preference for their father's song. Females that were later reexposed to their father's song showed significantly greater expression of Zenk, the protein product of the IEG ZENK, than controls that were exposed to a novel song, in the CMM, but not in the NCM or hippocampus. These results suggest that in female zebra finches the CMM may be (part of) the neural substrate for the representation of the memory of their father's song.},

abstract = {The pallido-recipient thalamus transmits information from the basal ganglia to the cortex and is critical for motor initiation and learning. Thalamic activity is strongly inhibited by pallidal inputs from the basal ganglia, but the role of nonpallidal inputs, such as excitatory inputs from cortex, remains unclear. We simultaneously recorded from presynaptic pallidal axon terminals and postsynaptic thalamocortical neurons in a basal ganglia-recipient thalamic nucleus that is necessary for vocal variability and learning in zebra finches. We found that song-locked rate modulations in the thalamus could not be explained by pallidal inputs alone and persisted following pallidal lesion. Instead, thalamic activity was likely driven by inputs from a motor cortical nucleus that is also necessary for singing. These findings suggest a role for cortical inputs to the pallido-recipient thalamus in driving premotor signals that are important for exploratory behavior and learning.},

abstract = {Though the music produced by an ensemble is influenced by multiple factors, including musical genre, musician skill, and individual interpretation, rhythmic synchronization is at the foundation of musical interaction. Here, we study the statistical nature of the mutual interaction between two humans synchronizing rhythms. We find that the interbeat intervals of both laypeople and professional musicians exhibit scale-free (power law) cross-correlations. Surprisingly, the next beat to be played by one person is dependent on the entire history of the other person's interbeat intervals on timescales up to several minutes. To understand this finding, we propose a general stochastic model for mutually interacting complex systems, which suggests a physiologically motivated explanation for the occurrence of scale-free cross-correlations. We show that the observed long-term memory phenomenon in rhythmic synchronization can be imitated by fractal coupling of separately recorded or synthesized audio tracks and thus applied in electronic music. Though this study provides an understanding of fundamental characteristics of timing and synchronization at the interbrain level, the mutually interacting complex systems model may also be applied to study the dynamics of other complex systems where scale-free cross-correlations have been observed, including econophysics, physiological time series, and collective behavior of animal flocks.},

However, recent studies indicate that different neuronal types adopt distinct modes of migration in the developing cortex. Here, we review evidence for two modes of radial movement: somal translocation, which is adopted by the early-generated neurons; and glia-guided locomotion, which is used predominantly by pyramidal cells. Cortical interneurons, which originate in the ventral telencephalon, use a third mode of migration. They migrate tangentially into the cortex, then seek the ventricular zone before moving radially to take up their positions in the cortical anlage.},

abstract = {Facilitation and inhibition are asymmetric aspects of attention that differentially affect response times (RTs), accuracy and neuroelectric activity in many experimental tasks. Both vary as a function of stimulus context, with stimulus repetitions, for example, often resulting in facilitation in terms of speed, accuracy or reduced neural activity. Although inhibition has been extensively studied in the Go/NoGo task, facilitation has been overlooked. Twenty healthy adults performed an adapted Go/NoGo task which manipulated levels of facilitation and inhibition. Event-related potential (ERP) and behavioural measures were averaged according to preceding stimulus sequences. Established Go/NoGo effects for N2 and P3 components were replicated. Behavioural and ERP measures, however, showed strong sequence effects. Correlates of facilitation included reduced P1 and N1 latencies, and topographic effects in P1, to Go stimulus repetitions. Manipulations of inhibitory load through increasing Go before NoGo stimuli resulted in incremental increases in N1, P2 and N2 latencies. Several additional ERP and RT measures showed quadratic effects, with indications of facilitation or inhibition which reversed towards the end of longer stimulus trains. The results suggest that both facilitatory and inhibitory processes underlie performance in the Go/NoGo task. As Go stimuli are typically more frequently repeated than NoGo stimuli, the two processes may be confounded when sequence effects are not considered. Additionally, analysing stimuli by context indicates that the timing of the Go-P3 latency is closely related to responses, and the prolongation of N1, P2 and N2 with increasing difficulty of inhibition supports a possible relation of these components to inhibition. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Previous studies demonstrate that perception of action presented audio-visually facilitates greater mirror neuron system (MNS) activity in humans (Kaplan and Iacoboni in Cogn Process 8(2):103-113, 2007) and non-human primates (Keysers et al. in Exp Brain Res 153(4):628-636, 2003) than perception of action presented unimodally. In the current study, we examined whether audio-visual facilitation of the MNS can be indexed using electroencephalography (EEG) measurement of the mu rhythm. The mu rhythm is an EEG oscillation with peaks at 10 and 20 Hz that is suppressed during the execution and perception of action and is speculated to reflect activity in the premotor and inferior parietal cortices as a result of MNS activation (Pineda in Behav Brain Funct 4(1):47, 2008). Participants observed experimental stimuli unimodally (visual-alone or audio-alone) or bimodally during randomized presentations of two hands ripping a sheet of paper, and a control video depicting a box moving up and down. Audio-visual perception of action stimuli led to greater event-related desynchrony (ERD) of the 8-13 Hz mu rhythm compared to unimodal perception of the same stimuli over the C3 electrode, as well as in a left central cluster when data were examined in source space. These results are consistent with Kaplan and Iacoboni's (in Cogn Process 8(2):103-113, 2007), findings that indicate audio-visual facilitation of the MNS; our left central cluster was localized approximately 13.89 mm away from the ventral premotor cluster identified in their fMRI study, suggesting that these clusters originate from similar sources. Consistency of results in electrode space and component space support the use of ICA as a valid source localization tool.},

abstract = {In female rats the gonadal hormones estrogen and progesterone modulate dopamine (DA) activity in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. For example, there is estrous cycle-dependent variation in basal extracellular concentration of striatal DA, in amphetamine (AMPH)-stimulated DA release, and in striatal DA-mediated behaviors. Ovariectomy attenuates basal extracellular DA, AMPH-induced striatal DA release, and behaviors mediated by the striatal DA system. Estrogen rapidly and directly acts on the striatum and accumbens, via a G-protein-coupled external membrane receptor, to enhance DA release and DA-mediated behaviors. In male rats, estrogen does not affect striatal DA release, and removal of testicular hormones is without effect. These effects of estrogen also result in gender differences in sensitization to psychomotor stimulants. The effects of the gonadal hormones on the striatum and ascending DA systems projecting to the striatum and nucleus accumbens are hypothesized to occur as follows: estrogen induces a rapid change in neuronal excitability by acting on membrane receptors located in intrinsic striatal GABAergic neurons and on DA terminals. The effect of these two actions results in enhanced stimulated DA release through modulation of terminal excitability. These effects of gonadal hormones are postulated to have important implications for gender differences in susceptibility to addiction to the psychomotor stimulants. It is suggested that hormonal modulation of the striatum may have evolved to facilitate reproductive success in female rats by enhancing pacing behavior.},

abstract = {Motor-related forebrain areas in higher vertebrates also show responses to passively presented sensory stimuli. However, sensory tuning properties in these areas, especially during wakefulness, and their relation to perception, are poorly understood. In the avian song system, HVC (proper name) is a vocal-motor structure with auditory responses well defined under anesthesia but poorly characterized during wakefulness. We used a large set of stimuli including the bird's own song (BOS) and many conspecific songs (CON) to characterize auditory tuning properties in putative interneurons (HVC(IN)) during wakefulness. Our findings suggest that HVC contains a diversity of responses that vary in overall excitability to auditory stimuli, as well as bias in spike rate increases to BOS over CON. We used statistical tests to classify cells in order to further probe auditory responses, yielding one-third of neurons that were either unresponsive or suppressed and two-thirds with excitatory responses to one or more stimuli. A subset of excitatory neurons were tuned exclusively to BOS and showed very low linearity as measured by spectrotemporal receptive field analysis (STRF). The remaining excitatory neurons responded well to CON stimuli, although many cells still expressed a bias toward BOS. These findings suggest the concurrent presence of a nonlinear and a linear component to responses in HVC, even within the same neuron. These characteristics are consistent with perceptual deficits in distinguishing BOS from CON stimuli following lesions of HVC and other song nuclei and suggest mirror neuronlike qualities in which "self" (here BOS) is used as a referent to judge "other" (here CON).},

We report here that auditory neurons can be classified into functional groups, each of which plays a specific role in extracting distinct complex sound features. We recorded the electrophysiological responses of single auditory neurons in the songbird midbrain and forebrain to conspecific song, measured their tuning by calculating spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs), and classified them using multiple cluster analysis methods. Based on STRF shape, cells clustered into functional groups that divided the space of acoustical features into regions that represent cues for the fundamental acoustic percepts of pitch, timbre, and rhythm. Four major groups were found in the midbrain, and five major groups were found in the forebrain. Comparing STRFs in midbrain and forebrain neurons suggested that both inheritance and emergence of tuning properties occur as information ascends the auditory processing stream.},

This article brings together the major developments in research on how these dimensions are perceived and remembered, beginning with psychophysical results on time and pitch perception. Progressively larger units are considered, moving from basic psychological categories of temporal and frequency ratios, to pulse and scale, to metrical and tonal hierarchies, to the formation of musical rhythms and melodies, and finally to the cognitive representation of large-scale musical form. Interactions between the dimensions are considered, and major theoretical proposals are described. The article identifies various links between musical structure and perceptual and cognitive processes, suggesting psychological influences on how sounds are patterned in music.},

abstract = {Obligate avian brood parasites are raised by heterospecific hosts and, therefore, lack crucial early exposure to relatives and other conspecifics. Yet, young brood parasites readily recognize and affiliate with others of their own species upon independence. One solution to this social recognition paradox is the ontogenetic ` password' mechanism used by obligate parasitic brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), whereby conspecific identification is initially mediated through the cowbird chatter: a non-learned vocal cue. We explored the neural basis of such password-based species recognition in juvenile and adult male cowbirds. We found that cowbird auditory forebrain regions express greater densities of the protein product of the immediate-early gene ZENK in response to the password chatter call relative to control sounds of mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) coos. The chatter-selective induction of ZENK expression occurs in both the caudal medial nidopallium (NCM) and the caudal medial mesopallium (CMM) in adults, but only within the NCM in juveniles. In contrast, we discovered that juvenile cowbirds exhibit neural selectivity to presentations of either conspecific or heterospecific songs, but only in CMM and only after recent experience. Juvenile cowbirds that did not have previous experience with the song type they were exposed to during the test period exhibited significantly lower activity-dependent gene expression. Thus, in juvenile male cowbirds, there is early onset of species-specific selective neural representation of non-learned calls in NCM and recently experienced song in CMM. These results suggest that NCM is evolutionarily co-opted in parasitic cowbirds to selectively recognize the password chatter, allowing juvenile cowbirds to identify adult conspecifics and avoid mis-imprinting upon unrelated host species. These ontogenetic comparisons reveal novel insights into the neural basis of species recognition in brood parasitic species.},

Participants first performed a Go-Nogo task in response to Asian and Caucasian faces (with race determining their Go or Nogo status), followed by a trustworthiness rating for each face. Faces previously seen as Nogo stimuli were rated as less trustworthy than previous Go stimuli. To study links between the efficiency of response inhibition in the Go-Nogo task and subsequent emotional evaluations, the Nogo N2 component was quantified separately for faces that were later judged to be high versus low in trustworthiness. Nogo N2 amplitudes were larger in response to low-rated as compared to high-rated faces, demonstrating that trial-by-trial variations in the efficiency of response inhibition triggered by Nogo faces, as measured by the Nogo N2 component, co-vary with their subsequent affective evaluation. These results suggest close links between inhibitory processes in top-down motor control and emotional responses.},

In advanced aging, frontal-striatal systems are preferentially vulnerable to white matter change, atrophy, and certain forms of neurotransmitter depletion. Frontal-striatal change may underlie mild memory difficulties in aging that are most apparent on tasks demanding high levels of attention and controlled processing. Through separate mechanisms, Alzheimer's disease preferentially affects the medial temporal lobe and cortical networks, including posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex early in its progression, often before clinical symptoms are recognized. Disruption of the medial temporal lobe memory system leads directly to memory impairment. Recent findings further suggest that age-associated change is not received passively. Reliance on reserve is emerging as an important factor that determines who ages gracefully and who declines rapidly. Functional imaging studies, in particular, suggest increased recruitment of brain areas in older adults that may reflect a form of compensation.},

Possibly reflecting his savant skills, the superior parietal region of GW's cortex was the only area thicker (while areas such as the superior and medial prefrontal, middle temporal and motor cortices were thinner) than that of a neurotypical control group. Taken from the perspective of learning/practice-based models, skills in domains (e.g. calendars, art, music) that capitalize upon strengths often associated with ASD, such as detail-focused processing, are probably further enhanced through over-learning and massive exposure, and reflected in atypical brain structure.},

abstract = {Complex motor skill often consists of a fixed sequence of movements. Recent studies show that a stereotyped temporal pattern or rhythm emerges as we learn to perform a motor sequence. This is because the sequence is reorganized during learning as serial chunks of movements in both a sequence-specific and subject-specific manner. On the basis of human imaging studies we propose that the formation of chunk patterns is controlled by the cerebellum, its posterior and anterior lobes contributing, respectively, to the temporal patterns before and after chunk formation. The motor rhythm can assist the motor networks in the cerebral cortex to control automatic movements within chunks and the cognitive networks to control non-automatic movements between chunks, respectively. In this way, organized motor skill can be performed automatically and flexibly.},

abstract = {Learning typically increases the strength of responses and the number of neurons that respond to training stimuli. Few studies have explored representational plasticity using natural stimuli, however, leaving unknown the changes that accompany learning under more realistic conditions. Here, we examine experience-dependent plasticity in European starlings, a songbird with rich acoustic communication signals tied to robust, natural recognition behaviors. We trained starlings to recognize conspecific songs and recorded the extracellular spiking activity of single neurons in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), a secondary auditory forebrain region analogous to mammalian auditory cortex. Training induced a stimulus-specific weakening of the neural responses (lower spike rates) to the learned songs, whereas the population continued to respond robustly to unfamiliar songs. Additional experiments rule out stimulus-specific adaptation and general biases for novel stimuli as explanations of these effects. Instead, the results indicate that associative learning leads to single neuron responses in which both irrelevant and unfamiliar stimuli elicit more robust responses than behaviorally relevant natural stimuli. Detailed analyses of these effects at a finer temporal scale point to changes in the number of motifs eliciting excitatory responses above a neuron's spontaneous discharge rate. These results show a novel form of experience-dependent plasticity in the auditory forebrain that is tied to associative learning and in which the overall strength of responses is inversely related to learned behavioral significance.},

abstract = {Acousticians generally assess the acoustic qualities of a concert hall or any other room using impulse response-based measures such as the reverberation time, clarity index, and others. These parameters are used to predict perceptual attributes related to the acoustic qualities of the room. Various studies show that these physical measures are not able to predict the related perceptual attributes sufficiently well under all circumstances. In particular, it has been shown that physical measures are dependent on the state of occupation, are prone to exaggerated spatial fluctuation, and suffer from lacking discrimination regarding the kind of acoustic stimulus being presented. Accordingly, this paper proposes a method for the derivation of signal-based measures aiming at predicting aspects of room acoustic perception from content specific signal representations produced by a binaural, nonlinear model of the human auditory system. Listening tests were performed to test the proposed auditory parameters for both speech and music. The results look promising; the parameters correlate with their corresponding perceptual attributes in most cases.},

During quiet wakefulness, the brain produces spontaneous firing events that can spread over large areas of cortex and have been suggested to underlie processes such as memory recall and consolidation. Here we demonstrate a different role for spontaneous activity in sensory cortex: gating of sensory inputs. We show that population activity in rat auditory cortex is composed of transient 50-100 ms packets of spiking activity that occur irregularly during silence and sustained tone stimuli, but reliably at tone onset. Population activity within these packets had broadly consistent spatiotemporal structure, but the rate and also precise relative timing of action potentials varied between stimuli. Packet frequency varied with cortical state, with desynchronized state activity consistent with superposition of multiple overlapping packets. We suggest that such packets reflect the sporadic opening of a "gate" that allows auditory cortex to broadcast a representation of external sounds to other brain regions.},

In the present study, we investigated whether repetitions of a song stimulus also elicited a decrement in the electrophysiological responses in the NCM neurons of these birds. Multiunit auditory responses in NCM were initially vigorous, but their amplitude decreased (habituated) rapidly to repeated stimulation, declining to about 40{\%} of the initial response during the first 50 iterations. A similar time course of change was seen at the single unit level. This habituation occurred specifically for each song presented but did not occur when pure tones were used as a stimulus. Habituation to conspecific, but not heterospecific, song was retained for 20 h or longer. Injections of inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis at the recording site did not affect the initial habituation to a novel stimulus, but these drugs blocked the long-term habituation when injected at 0.5-3 h and at 5.5-7 h after the first exposure to the stimulus. Thus, at least two waves of gene induction appear to be necessary for long-lasting habituation to a particular song.},

abstract = {The ability of three species of birds to discriminate among selected harmonic complexes with fundamental frequencies varying from 50 to 1000 Hz was examined in behavioral experiments. The stimuli were synthetic harmonic complexes with waveform shapes altered by component phase selection, holding spectral and intensive information constant. Birds were able to discriminate between waveforms with randomly selected component phases and those with all components in cosine phase, as well as between positive and negative Schroeder-phase waveforms with harmonic periods as short as 1-2 ms. By contrast, human listeners are unable to make these discriminations at periods less than about 3-4 ms. Electrophysiological measures, including cochlear microphonic and compound action potential measurements to the same stimuli used in behavioral tests, showed differences between birds and gerbils paralleling, but not completely accounting for, the psychophysical differences observed between birds and humans. It appears from these data that birds can hear the fine temporal structure in complex waveforms over very short periods. These data show birds are capable of more precise temporal resolution for complex sounds than is observed in humans and perhaps other mammals. Physiological data further show that at least part of the mechanisms underlying this high temporal resolving power resides at the peripheral level of the avian auditory system.},

In rat hippocampal slices, neuronal activity rapidly decreased the levels of extracellular O2 and intracellular NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), even with lactate dehydrogenase blocked to prevent lactate generation, or with only 20{\%} superfused O2 to mimic physiological O2 levels. Pharmacological analysis revealed an energy budget in which 11{\%} of O2 use was on presynaptic action potentials, 17{\%} was on presynaptic Ca2+ entry and transmitter release, 46{\%} was on postsynaptic glutamate receptors, and 26{\%} was on postsynaptic action potentials, in approximate accord with theoretical brain energy budgets.

abstract = {In recent years, simple GO/NOGO behavioural tasks have become popular due to the relative ease with which they can be combined with technologies such as in vivo multiphoton imaging. To date, it has been assumed that behavioural performance can be captured by the average performance across a session, however this neglects the effect of motivation on behaviour within individual sessions. We investigated the effect of motivation on mice performing a GO/NOGO visual discrimination task. Performance within a session tended to follow a stereotypical trajectory on a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) chart, beginning with an over-motivated state with many false positives, and transitioning through a more or less optimal regime to end with a low hit rate after satiation. Our observations are reproduced by a new model, the Motivated Actor-Critic, introduced here. Our results suggest that standard measures of discriminability, obtained by averaging across a session, may significantly underestimate behavioural performance.},

abstract = {Songbirds have unique value as a model for memory and learning. In their natural social life, they communicate through vocalizations that they must learn to produce and recognize. Song communication elicits abrupt changes in gene expression in regions of the forebrain responsible for song perception and production-what is the functional significance of this genomic response? For 20 years, the focus of research was on just a few genes [primarily ZENK, now known as egr1 (early gene response 1)]. Recently, however, DNA microarrays have been developed and applied to songbird behavioral research, and in 2010 the initial draft assembly of the zebra finch genome was published. Together, these new data reveal that the genomic involvement in song processing is far more complex than anticipated. The concepts of neurogenomic computation and biological embedding are introduced as frameworks for future research. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics Volume 14 is August 31, 2013.

Recent experiments point to areas outside the traditional song system for being relevant to sensory functions implicated in song learning. By manipulating or suppressing activity in these areas, adult birds lose their ability to recognize the songs of their tutors and juveniles are unable to form accurate copies of tutor song.

Visual illusions offer valuable insight into the mechanisms of perceptual coding. One such illusion, the tilt after-effect (TAE), has been studied extensively since the 1930s, yet a full explanation of the effect has remained elusive. Here, we put forward an explanation of the TAE in terms of a functional role for adaptation in the visual cortex. The proposed model accounts not only for the phenomenology of the TAE, but also for spatial interactions in perceived tilt and the effects of adaptation on the perception of direction of motion and colour. We discuss the implications of the model for understanding the effects of adaptation and surround stimulation on the response properties of cortical neurons.},

While the function of those spontaneous patterns of activation remains poorly understood, recent studies both in vivo and in vitro have demonstrated that neocortical neurons activate in a surprisingly similar sequential order both spontaneously and following input into cortex. For example, neurons that tend to fire earlier within spontaneous bursts of activity also fire earlier than other neurons in response to sensory stimuli. These "default patterns" can last hundreds of milliseconds and are strongly conserved under a variety of conditions. In this paper, we will review recent evidence for these default patterns at the local cortical level. We speculate that cortical architecture imposes common constraints on spontaneous and evoked activity flow, which result in the similarity of the patterns.},

While humans naturally attend to and process many of the psychophysical cues present in musical information, there is a great — and often culture-specific — diversity of musical practices differentiated in part by form, timbre, pitch, rhythm, and other structural elements. Musical interactions situated within a given cultural context begin to influence human responses to music as early as one year of age. Despite the world's diversity of musical cultures, the majority of research in cognitive psychology and the cognitive neuroscience of music has been conducted on subjects and stimuli from Western music cultures. From the standpoint of cognitive neuroscience, identification of fundamental cognitive and neurological processes associated with music requires ascertaining that such processes are demonstrated by listeners from a broad range of cultural backgrounds and in relation to various musics across cultural traditions. This chapter will review current research regarding the role of enculturation in music perception and cognition and the degree to which cultural influences are reflected in brain function. Exploring music cognition from the standpoint of culture will lead to a better understanding of the core processes underlying perception and how those processes give rise to the world's diversity of music forms and expressions.},

@article{Smulders2013,
abstract = {Repeated exposure to an auditory stimulus leads to habituation of the electrophysiological and immediate-early-gene (IEG) expression response in the auditory system. A novel auditory stimulus reinstates this response in a form of dishabituation. This has been interpreted as the start of new memory formation for this novel stimulus. Changes in the location of an otherwise identical auditory stimulus can also dishabituate the IEG expression response. This has been interpreted as an integration of stimulus identity and stimulus location into a single auditory object, encoded in the firing patterns of the auditory system. In this study, we further tested this hypothesis. Using chronic multi-electrode arrays to record multi-unit activity from the auditory system of awake and behaving zebra finches, we found that habituation occurs to repeated exposure to the same song and dishabituation with a novel song, similar to that described in head-fixed, restrained animals. A large proportion of recording sites also showed dishabituation when the same auditory stimulus was moved to a novel location. However, when the song was randomly moved among 8 interleaved locations, habituation occurred independently of the continuous changes in location. In contrast, when 8 different auditory stimuli were interleaved all from the same location, a separate habituation occurred to each stimulus. This result suggests that neuronal memories of the acoustic identity and spatial location are different, and that allocentric location of a stimulus is not encoded as part of the memory for an auditory object, while its acoustic properties are. We speculate that, instead, the dishabituation that occurs with a change from a stable location of a sound is due to the unexpectedness of the location change, and might be due to different underlying mechanisms than the dishabituation and separate habituations to different acoustic stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is widely used in neural circuits giving rise to learning and memory. NO is an unusual neurotransmitter in its modes of release and action. Is its association with learning and memory related to its unusual properties? Reviewing the literature might allow the formulation of a general principle on how NO and memory are related. However, other than confirming that there is indeed a strong association between NO and memory, no simple rules emerge on the role of NO in learning and memory. The effects of NO are not associated with a particular stage or form of memory and are highly dependent on species, strain, and behavior or training paradigm. Nonetheless, a review does provide hints on why NO is associated with learning and memory. Unlike transmitters acting via receptors expressed only in neurons designed to respond to the transmitter, NO is a promiscuous signal that can affect a wide variety of neurons, via many molecular mechanisms. In circuits giving rise to learning and memory, it may be useful to signal some events via a promiscuous messenger having widespread effects. However, each circuit will use the promiscuous signal in a different way, to achieve different ends.},

abstract = {Like many other songbird species, male zebra finches learn their song from a tutor early in life. Song learning in birds has strong parallels with speech acquisition in human infants at both the behavioral and neural levels. Forebrain nuclei in the 'song system' are important for the sensorimotor acquisition and production of song, while caudomedial pallial brain regions outside the song system are thought to contain the neural substrate of tutor song memory. Here, we exposed three groups of adult zebra finch males to either tutor song, to their own song, or to novel conspecific song. Expression of the immediate early gene protein product Zenk was measured in the song system nuclei HVC, robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and Area X. There were no significant differences in overall Zenk expression between the three groups. However, Zenk expression in the HVC was significantly positively correlated with the strength of song learning only in the group that was exposed to the bird's own song, not in the other two groups. These results suggest that the song system nucleus HVC may contain a neural representation of a memory of the bird's own song. Such a representation may be formed during juvenile song learning and guide the bird's vocal output.},

abstract = {In male songbirds, the song control pathway in the forebrain is responsible for song production and learning, and in females it is associated with the perception and discrimination of male song. However, experiments using the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) reveal the activation of brain regions outside the song control system, in particular the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and the caudomedial mesopallium (CMM). In this study on female canaries, we investigate the role of these two regions in relation to playback of male songs of different quality. Male canaries produce elaborate songs and some contain syllables with a more complex structure (sexy syllables) that induce females to perform copulation solicitation displays (CSD) as an invitation to mate. Females were first exposed to playback of a range of songs of different quality, before they were finally tested with playback of songs containing either sexy or nonsexy syllables. We then sectioned the brains and used in situ hybridization to reveal brain regions that express the IEGs ZENK or Arc. In CMM, expression of ZENK mRNA was significantly higher in females that last heard sexy syllables compared to those that last heard nonsexy syllables, but this was not the case for NCM. Expression of Arc mRNA revealed no differences in either CMM or NCM in both experimental groups. These results provide evidence that in female canaries CMM is involved in female perception and discrimination of male song quality through a mechanism of memory reconsolidation. The results also have further implications for the evolution of complex songs by sexual selection and female choice.},

However, evidence from experiments on awake animals has shown that both eye movements and behavioral state can strongly modulate responses of neurons in visual cortex; the functional significance of this modulation, however, remains elusive. Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback. These data suggest that processing in visual cortex may be based on predictive coding strategies that use motor-related and visual input to detect mismatches between predicted and actual visual feedback.},

abstract = {In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, most genes appear to be transcribed during short periods called transcriptional bursts, interspersed by silent intervals. We describe how such bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in mammalian cells. To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

abstract = {We conducted two experiments on song memorization in zebra finches using a new measure of song recognition memory. We passively exposed zebra finches to songs presented from a loudspeaker, then trained them to discriminate a subset of the exposed songs from novel ones in a Go/No-go operant discrimination between familiar and novel songs. Following discrimination training, untrained exposed and novel probe songs were presented without reinforcement. The birds generalized their responses from the training songs to the unreinforced probe songs, demonstrating recognition memory for the previously exposed probe songs. The results show that juvenile females (experiment 1) and juvenile males (experiment 2) memorize several conspecific songs through passive exposure. Song recognition memory was maintained for a minimum of 3 weeks (experiment 1), and there was no difference in recognition memory for conspecific or heterospecific songs in juvenile males that were exposed to song during the sensitive period (experiment 2). The new procedure uses the power of operant conditioning techniques to assess recognition memory, while controlling for possible artificial influences of operant procedures on the song memorization process. The findings of experiment 2 have implications for theories of selective learning of bird song. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {We analyzed the receptive field information conveyed by interspike intervals (ISIs) in the auditory cortex. In the visual system, different ISIs may both code for different visual features and convey differing amounts of stimulus information. To determine their potential role in auditory signal processing, we obtained extracellular recordings in the primary auditory cortex (AI) of the cat while presenting a dynamic moving ripple stimulus and then used the responses to construct spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs). For each neuron, we constructed three STRFs, one for short-ISI events (ISI {\textless} 15 ms); one for isolated, long-ISI events (ISI {\textgreater} 15 ms); and one including all events. To characterize stimulus encoding, we calculated the feature selectivity and event information for each of the STRFs. Short-ISI spikes were more feature selective and conveyed information more efficiently. The different ISI regimens of AI neurons did not represent different stimulus features, but short-ISI spike events did contribute over-proportionately to the full spike train STRF information. Thus short-ISIs constitute a robust representation of auditory features, and they are particularly effective at driving postsynaptic activity. This suggests that short-ISI events are especially suited to provide noise immunity and high-fidelity information transmission in AI.},

abstract = {A prominent theory states that animal phenotypes arise by evolutionary changes in gene regulation, but the extent to which this theory holds true for behavioral evolution is not known. Because "nature and nurture" are now understood to involve hereditary and environmental influences on gene expression, we studied whether environmental influences on a behavioral phenotype, i.e., aggression, could have evolved into inherited differences via changes in gene expression. Here, with microarray analysis of honey bees, we show that aggression-related genes with inherited patterns of brain expression are also environmentally regulated. There were expression differences in the brain for hundreds of genes between the highly aggressive Africanized honey bee compared with European honey bee (EHB) subspecies. Similar results were obtained for EHB in response to exposure to alarm pheromone (which provokes aggression) and when comparing old and young bees (aggressive tendencies increase with age). There was significant overlap of the gene lists generated from these three microarray experiments. Moreover, there was statistical enrichment of several of the same cis regulatory motifs in promoters of genes on all three gene lists. Aggression shows a remarkably robust brain molecular signature regardless of whether it occurs because of inherited, age-related, or environmental (social) factors. It appears that one element in the evolution of different degrees of aggressive behavior in honey bees involved changes in regulation of genes that mediate the response to alarm pheromone.},

Conversely, implicit timing is engaged, even without a specific instruction to time, whenever sensorimotor information is temporally structured and can be used to predict the duration of future events. Both emergent timing (motor) and temporal expectation (perceptual) are forms of implicit timing. Recent fMRI studies demonstrate discrete neural substrates for explicit and implicit timing. Specifically, basal ganglia are activated almost invariably by explicit timing, with co-activation of prefrontal, premotor and cerebellar areas being more context-dependent. Conversely, implicit perceptual timing (or "temporal expectation") recruits cortical action circuits, comprising inferior parietal and premotor areas, highlighting its role in the optimisation of prospective behaviour.},

abstract = {Many learned behaviors are thought to require the activity of high-level neurons that represent categories of complex signals, such as familiar faces or native speech sounds. How these complex, experience-dependent neural responses emerge within the brain's circuitry is not well understood. The caudomedial mesopallium (CMM), a secondary auditory region in the songbird brain, contains neurons that respond to specific combinations of song components and respond preferentially to the songs that birds have learned to recognize. Here, we examine the transformation of these learned responses across a broader forebrain circuit that includes the caudolateral mesopallium (CLM), an auditory region that provides input to CMM. We recorded extracellular single-unit activity in CLM and CMM in European starlings trained to recognize sets of conspecific songs and compared multiple encoding properties of neurons between these regions. We find that the responses of CMM neurons are more selective between song components, convey more information about song components, and are more variable over repeated components than the responses of CLM neurons. While learning enhances neural encoding of song components in both regions, CMM neurons encode more information about the learned categories associated with songs than do CLM neurons. Collectively, these data suggest that CLM and CMM are part of a functional sensory hierarchy that is modified by learning to yield representations of natural vocal signals that are increasingly informative with respect to behavior.},

@article{Schuessler2014,
abstract = {Forward predictions are not only crucial to predict somatosensory consequences of movements, but may also guide cross-modal sensory mapping (Ramnani, 2006). When a visual stimulus temporally predicts an auditory tone onset (‘when' information), the amplitude of the N1-P2 complex is reduced compared to a temporally unpredictable tone (e.g., Ford et al., 2007; Sowman, Kuusik, {\&} Johnson, 2012). However, cue quality and/or tone identity (‘what' information) may further modulate visual-to- auditory predictions. When the quality of a visual cue varies, its strength to predict a subsequent tone onset influences cross- modal sensory mapping. In addition, infrequently occurring deviant tones (altered in frequency) induce uncertainty about tone identity that may further impact visual-to-auditory predictions (cf. Schwartze, Farrugia, {\&} Kotz, 2013, for sensory predictions). A visual-to-auditory cross-modal prediction paradigm was used in the current experiment. Participants passively viewed visual cues that temporally predicted a subsequent tone onset or not. We manipulated (1) the predictive strength of a visual cue (five different cue colors vs. one [grey] color), (2) the probability of an auditory tone to occur (80{\%} standard, 20{\%} deviant tones), and (3) temporal predictability (predictable vs. unpredictable tone onset). Predictable blocks either preceded unpredictable blocks or vice versa (between subjects-design). This allowed investigating whether frequent standard tones are affected by uncertainty of tone identity (‘what' information) as a function of temporal predictability (‘when' information). The results on lateral electrodes revealed that the N1-P2 complex to standard tones was modulated by temporal predictability. The N100 amplitude was enhanced (predictable{\textgreater}unpredictable) when predictable blocks preceded unpredictable blocks, while the N100 amplitude was reduced (predictable{\textless}unpredictable) for unpredictable blocks preceding predictable blocks. These effects did not vary as a function of cue quality. The P200 response was attenuated (predictable{\textless}unpredictable) for colored and grey cues, but only when unpredictable blocks were presented first. This finding is comparable to previous results, in which tone identity was always fully predictable. This suggests that the P200 component is not susceptible to uncertainty of tone identity. In contrast, N100 findings differ between the two studies. Whereas the N100 showed a main effect of temporal predictability (predictable{\textless}unpredictable) when tone identity was 100{\%} certain, the N100 amplitude was altered by temporal predictability (‘when' information) depending on block order in the current study. This can be explained by a global order effect, in which initial blocks receive more attention than succeeding blocks. However, only predictable blocks were modulated by block order. Thus, a more reasonable explanation for the present results is that the saliency of deviant tones attracts attention, which, in turn, affects temporal predictability. Future research needs to further address whether cross-modal sensory mapping is indeed susceptible to attention.},

Here, we review a program of work in which we specifically tested this assumption by studying the effects of a range of attentionally demanding concurrent tasks on the capacity to encode and retain both individual features and bound objects. We found no differential effect of concurrent load, even when the process of binding was made more demanding by separating the shape and color features spatially, temporally or across visual and auditory modalities. Bound features were however more readily disrupted by subsequent stimuli, a process we studied using a suffix paradigm. This suggested a need to assume a feature-based attentional filter followed by an object based storage process. Our results are interpreted within a modified version of the multicomponent working memory model. We also discuss work examining the role of the hippocampus in visual feature binding.},

abstract = {Recently, fMRI was introduced in a well-documented animal model for vocal learning, the songbird. Using fMRI and conspecific signals mixed with different levels of broadband noise, we now demonstrate auditory-induced activation representing discriminatory properties of auditory forebrain regions in anesthetized male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Earlier behavioral tests showed comparable calling responses to the original conspecific song stimulus heard outside and inside the magnet. A significant fMRI response was elicited by conspecific song in the primary auditory thalamo-recipient subfield L2a; in neighboring subareas L2b, L3, and L; and in the rostral part of the higher-order auditory area NCM (caudomedial nidopallium). Temporal BOLD response clustering revealed rostral and caudal clusters that we defined as "cluster Field L" and "cluster NCM", respectively. However, because the actual border between caudal Field L subregions and NCM cannot be seen in the structural MR image and is not precisely reported elsewhere, the cluster NCM might also contain subregion L and the medial extremes of the subregions L2b and L3. Our results show that whereas in cluster Field L the response was not reduced by added noise, in cluster NCM the response was reduced and finally disappeared with increasing levels of noise added to the song stimulus. The activation in cluster NCM was significant for only two experimental stimuli that showed significantly more behavioral responses than the more degraded stimuli, suggesting that the first area within the auditory system where the ability to discern song from masking noise emerges is located in cluster NCM.},

Such depression occurs first in layer II/III and may reflect plasticity at vertical inputs from layer IV to layer II/III pyramids. Here, I describe a timing-based, associative form of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD) at this synapse in S1. LTP occurred when excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) led single postsynaptic action potentials (APs) within a narrow temporal window, and LTD occurred when APs led EPSPs within a significantly broader window. This long LTD window is unusual among timing-based learning rules and causes EPSPs that are uncorrelated with postsynaptic APs to become depressed. This behavior suggests a simple model for depression of deprived sensory responses in S1 and V1.},

Recent theoretical models have converged on a particular account, based on transient associations between independent item and context representations. In the present article, the authors present an alternative model, according to which sequence information is encoded through sustained patterns of activation within a recurrent neural network architecture. As demonstrated through a series of computer simulations, the model provides a parsimonious account for numerous benchmark characteristics of immediate serial recall, including data that have been considered to preclude the application of recurrent neural networks in this domain. Unlike most competing accounts, the model deals naturally with findings concerning the role of background knowledge in serial recall and makes contact with relevant neuroscientific data. Furthermore, the model gives rise to numerous testable predictions that differentiate it from competing theories.

With the advent of new sequencing technologies, we are able to characterize and study gene expression levels and associated regulatory mechanisms in a large number of individuals and species at an unprecedented resolution and scale. We have thus gained new insights into the evolutionary pressures that shape gene expression levels and have developed an appreciation for the relative importance of evolutionary changes in different regulatory genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The current challenge is to link gene regulatory changes to adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes. Here we mainly focus on comparative studies in primates and how they are complemented by studies in model organisms.},

abstract = {1.Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behavior are increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. 2.BORIS is a free, open-source and multi-platform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. 3.Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g., simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. 4.Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time budget for single or grouped observations automatically, and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioral features. The observation data and time budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL, JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS, PDF). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated as a messenger molecule in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) for almost 20 years, its precise function has not been elucidated because presynaptic and/or postsynaptic actions of NO have been reported. Most of the effects of NO as a signaling molecule are mediated by the NO receptor guanylyl cyclases (NO-GCs), two heme-containing enzymes with pronounced homology in which cGMP-forming activity is stimulated on NO binding. Here we report on knock-out (KO) mice in which either one of the NO-GC receptors has been genetically deleted. By measuring NO-induced cGMP levels, similar quantities of both NO-GC receptors were determined in the hippocampus. Surprisingly, hippocampal LTP was abolished in either one of the KO strains, demonstrating that both NO-GC receptors are required in the course of LTP. Expression of LTP was restored with a cGMP analog in one of the KO strains but did not recover in the other one. Moreover, single-cell recordings of paired pulse facilitation revealed a presynaptic role of one of the NO-GC isoforms in neurotransmitter release, confirming different roles of the NO-GC receptors in LTP. Because neither one of the NO/cGMP-induced responses by itself is sufficient for LTP, two divergent, possibly presynaptically and postsynaptically localized NO-stimulated cGMP pathways are apparently required for the expression of LTP. The unexpected role of cGMP at two sites of the synaptic cleft explains many of the controversial results in former NO research in LTP and demonstrates the necessity of presynaptic and postsynaptic changes for LTP expression.},

abstract = {Cultural transmission, the social learning of information or behaviors from conspecifics, is believed to occur in a number of groups of animals, including primates, cetaceans, and birds. Cultural traits can be passed vertically (from parents to offspring), obliquely (from the previous generation via a nonparent model to younger individuals), or horizontally (between unrelated individuals from similar age classes or within generations). Male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have a highly stereotyped, repetitive, and progressively evolving vocal sexual display or "song" that functions in sexual selection (through mate attraction and/or male social sorting). All males within a population conform to the current version of the display (song type), and similarities may exist among the songs of populations within an ocean basin. Here we present a striking pattern of horizontal transmission: multiple song types spread rapidly and repeatedly in a unidirectional manner, like cultural ripples, eastward through the populations in the western and central South Pacific over an 11-year period. This is the first documentation of a repeated, dynamic cultural change occurring across multiple populations at such a large geographic scale.},

We reanalyze Bem's data with a default Bayesian t test and show that the evidence for psi is weak to nonexistent. We argue that in order to convince a skeptical audience of a controversial claim, one needs to conduct strictly confirmatory studies and analyze the results with statistical tests that are conservative rather than liberal. We conclude that Bem's p values do not indicate evidence in favor of precognition; instead, they indicate that experimental psychologists need to change the way they conduct their experiments and analyze their data.},

abstract = {GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS and acts via GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors. Recently, a novel form of GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition, termed "tonic" inhibition, has been described. Whereas synaptic GABA(A) receptors underlie classical "phasic" GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition (inhibitory postsynaptic currents), tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition results from the activation of extrasynaptic receptors by low concentrations of ambient GABA. Extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors are composed of receptor subunits that convey biophysical properties ideally suited to the generation of persistent inhibition and are pharmacologically and functionally distinct from their synaptic counterparts. This mini-symposium review highlights ongoing work examining the properties of recombinant and native extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and their preferential targeting by endogenous and clinically relevant agents. In addition, it emphasizes the important role of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in GABAergic inhibition throughout the CNS and identifies them as a major player in both physiological and pathophysiological processes.},

On the other hand is the extensive literature suggesting that memory accurately preserves absolute features of experiences (Brooks, 1978; Jacoby, 1983; Medin {\&} Schaffer, 1978).

As with many psychological debates, there may be some degree of truth on both sides. Currently, philosophers of mind (Dennett, 1991) and cognitive scientists (Kosslyn, 1980) have also wondered to what extent our mental representations and memories of the world are perfect or accurate copies of experience, and to what extent distortions (or generalizations) intrude. {\textless}/m:italic{\textgreater}

The AFP also deviates from mammalian basal ganglia circuits in fundamental ways. In addition, the microcircuitry, role of neuromodulators, and function of Area X are still unclear.

During the past few years, research activities on different aspects of music processing and their neural correlates have rapidly progressed. This article provides an overview of recent developments and a framework for the perceptual side of music processing. This framework lays out a model of the cognitive modules involved in music perception, and incorporates information about the time course of activity of some of these modules, as well as research findings about where in the brain these modules might be located.},

abstract = {The eight photoreceptors in each ommatidium of the Drosophila eye are assembled by a process of recruitment [1,2]. First, the R8 cell is singled out, and then subsequent photoreceptors are added in pairs (R2 and R5, R3 and R4, R1 and R6) until the final R7 cell acquires a neuronal fate. R7 development requires the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase which is activated by a ligand from R8 [3]. Here, we report that the specification of R7 requires a second signal that activates Notch. We found that a Notch target gene is expressed in R7 shortly after recruitment. When Notch activity was reduced, the cell was misrouted to an R1/R6 fate. Conversely, when activated Notch was present in the R1/R6 cells, it caused them to adopt R7 fates or, occasionally, cone cell fates. In this context, Notch activity appears to act co-operatively, rather than antagonistically, with the receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras pathway in R7 photoreceptor specification. We propose two models: a ratchet model in which Notch would allow cells to remain competent to respond to sequential rounds of Ras signalling, and a combinatorial model in which Notch and Ras signalling would act together to regulate genes that determine cell fate.},

It is still a matter of debate, however, how best to characterise the functions of these regions, the hippocampus in particular. In this article, I examine the proposal that the hippocampus is a "stupid" module whose specific domain is consciously apprehended information. A number of interesting consequences for the organisation of memory and the brain follow from this proposal and the assumptions it entails. These, in turn, have important implications for neuropsychological theories of recent and remote episodic, semantic, and spatial memory and for the functions that episodic memory may serve in perception, comprehension, planning, imagination, and problem solving. I consider these implications by selectively reviewing the literature and primarily drawing on research my collaborators and I have conducted.},

abstract = {Complex brain functions, such as the capacity to learn and modulate vocal sequences, depend on activity propagation in highly distributed neural networks. To explore the synaptic basis of activity propagation in such networks, we made dual in vivo intracellular recordings in anesthetized zebra finches from the input (nucleus HVC, used here as a proper name) and output [lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN)] neurons of a songbird cortico-basal ganglia (BG) pathway necessary to the learning and modulation of vocal motor sequences. These recordings reveal evidence of bidirectional interactions, rather than only feedforward propagation of activity from HVC to LMAN, as had been previously supposed. A combination of dual and triple recording configurations and pharmacological manipulations was used to map out circuitry by which activity propagates from LMAN to HVC. These experiments indicate that activity travels to HVC through at least two independent ipsilateral pathways, one of which involves fast signaling through a midbrain dopaminergic cell group, reminiscent of recurrent mesocortical loops described in mammals. We then used in vivo pharmacological manipulations to establish that augmented LMAN activity is sufficient to restore high levels of sequence variability in adult birds, suggesting that recurrent interactions through highly distributed forebrain-midbrain pathways can modulate learned vocal sequences.},

abstract = {Evolution of communication is conceptualized as a coevolutionary process in which evolution of signaler and that of receiver occur in an interdependent manner. Three classes of communication, mutualistic, altruistic, and exploiting, are distinguished depending on who gains a benefit or suffers a cost from successful communication. Communication is also dichotomized according to whether individuals are innately able to send and receive relevant signals or they have to acquire those signals culturally. We develop two-locus haploid models that represent the coevolutionary nature of the evolution of communication, and derive the conditions under which communicators can invade a population of non-communicators and those under which a population of communicators is evolutionarily stable against the invasion by non-communicators for each of the three classes of communication. Analysis of the models reveals that interaction among siblings enables the invasion of communication and that the optimal probability of interaction with siblings depends on the class of communication and the mode of signal transmission. In addition, cultural exploiting communication is more likely to invade a population of non-communicators than is genetic exploiting communication under certain circumstances.},

These results indicate that a large portion of the measurable 5-HT output in the cerebellum is of neuronal origin, is dependent on impulse flow, and is sensitive to 5-HT1A autoreceptor activation. Further studies examined the relationship between 5-HT levels and general activity of the animals across the light-dark transition and during behavioral manipulations. Both 5-HT levels and behavioral activity were significantly elevated during the dark period, with changes in 5-HT efflux closely paralleling changes in activity. Similar increases (approximately 40{\%}) in 5-HT output were observed during both feeding and feeding in the presence of a stressor (tail pinch). These findings suggest that behavioral state is an important factor determining neuronal 5-HT release in cerebellum under physiological conditions.},

abstract = {A key discovery that has emerged from studies of the vocal system in songbirds is that neurons in these regions respond preferentially to playback of the bird's own song (BOS). This BOS selectivity is not a general property of neurons in primary and secondary auditory forebrain regions, field L and caudolateral mesopallium (CLM). Moreover, anatomical studies have been unable to conclusively define a direct projection from field L and/or CLM to HVC, a central structure for integrating sensory and motor information in the vocal system. To examine the communication between these regions, we used simultaneous dual-electrode recording in anesthetized male zebra finches and cross-correlation analysis to estimate the functional connectivity between auditory areas, field L and CLM, and HVC. We found that {\textgreater}or=18{\%} of neurons in field L and 33{\%} of neurons in CLM are functionally connected to HVC, most with auditory forebrain leading-HVC latencies ranging from 0.5 to 15 ms. These results indicate that field L and CLM communicate extensively with HVC through both direct and indirect anatomical connections. To further explore the role of the auditory forebrain cells that are functionally connected with HVC, we assessed their responsiveness and selectivity for a variety of natural and synthetic auditory stimuli. We found that field L and CLM neurons that are functionally connected to HVC exhibit generic auditory forebrain properties including the lack of BOS selectivity. This finding puts further constraints on the neural architecture and the nature of the nonlinearity that leads to BOS-selective auditory responses in the vocal control nuclei.},

@article{Romano2006,
abstract = {RATIONALE: Associative learning during Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning has been shown to be regulated by 5-HT2A receptors. The existence of inverse agonists that retard learning through an action at the 5-HT2A receptor suggests the existence of constitutive activity at that receptor and that depletion of serotonin should have minimal effects on learning.

OBJECTIVES: We examined whether depletion of serotonin would impair trace eyeblink conditioning or the enhancement of conditioning produced by the agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the retardation of conditioning produced by the inverse agonist MDL11,939.

METHODS: Animals received bilateral intraventricular injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) at doses of 760 or 1,140 microg/side (1.88 or 2.82 micromol/side) and were later exposed to eight daily conditioning sessions.

RESULTS: Serotonin depletion produced by the lower dose of 5,7-DHT was 71 and 72{\{}{\%}{\}} in cortex and hippocampus, respectively, with no change in 5-HT2A receptor density, no effect on learning, and no effect on the ability of LSD to enhance and MDL11,939 to retard learning. The higher dose of 5,7-DHT produced serotonin decreases of 85 and 90{\{}{\%}{\}} in cortex and hippocampus, respectively, accompanied by a 96{\{}{\%}{\}} decrease in the density of the serotonin transporter, but no significant effect on learning.

CONCLUSIONS: Pavlovian trace eyeblink conditioning is regulated predominantly by the constitutive activity of the 5-HT2A receptor rather than by serotonin release onto the receptor during learning. It was suggested that the 5-HT2A receptor regulates learning by modulating the release of dopamine, acetylcholine, and glutamate, transmitters known to affect eyeblink conditioning.},

abstract = {Temporal integration in duration and number discrimination by rats was investigated with the use of a psychophysical choice procedure. A response on one lever ("short" response) following a 1-s white-noise signal was followed by food reinforcement, and a response on the other lever ("long" response) following a 2-s white-noise signal was also followed by food reinforcement. Either response following a signal of one of five intermediate durations was unreinforced. This led to a psychophysical function in which the probability of a long response was related to signal duration in an ogival manner. On 2 test days, a white-noise signal with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 10 segments of either 0.5-s on and 0.5-s off or 1-s on and 1-s off was presented, and a choice response following these signals was unreinforced. The probability of a long response was the same function of a segmented signal and a continuous signal if each segment was considered equivalent to 200 ms. A quantitative fit of a scalar estimation theory suggested that the latencies to initiate temporal integration and to terminate the process are both about 200 ms, and that the same internal accumulation process can be used for counting and timing.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is assumed to retrieve memory byreinstating patterns of cortical activity that were observed during learning. To test this idea, we monitored the activity of individual cortical neurons while simultaneously inactivating the hippocampus. Neurons that were active during context fear conditioning were tagged with the long-lasting fluorescent protein H2B-GFP and the light-activated proton pump ArchT. These proteins allowed us to identify encoding neurons several days after learning and silence them with laser stimulation. When tagged CA1 cells were silenced, we found that memory retrieval was impaired and representations in the cortex (entorhinal, retrosplenial, perirhinal) and the amygdala could not be reactivated. Importantly, hippocampal inactivation did not alter the total amount of activity in most brain regions. Instead, it selectively prevented neurons that were active during learning from being reactivated during retrieval. These data provide functional evidence that the hippocampus reactivates specific memory representations during retrieval.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specialized neural pathways, the song system, are required for acquiring, producing, and perceiving learned avian vocalizations. Birds that do not learn to produce their vocalizations lack telencephalic song system components. It is not known whether the song system forebrain regions are exclusively evolved for song or whether they also process information not related to song that might reflect their 'evolutionary history'.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this question we monitored the induction of two immediate-early genes (IEGs) c-Fos and ZENK in various regions of the song system in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in response to an aversive food learning paradigm; this involves the association of a food item with a noxious stimulus that affects the oropharyngeal-esophageal cavity and tongue, causing subsequent avoidance of that food item. The motor response results in beak and head movements but not vocalizations. IEGs have been extensively used to map neuro-molecular correlates of song motor production and auditory processing. As previously reported, neurons in two pallial vocal motor regions, HVC and RA, expressed IEGs after singing. Surprisingly, c-Fos was induced equivalently also after food aversion learning in the absence of singing. The density of c-Fos positive neurons was significantly higher than that of birds in control conditions. This was not the case in two other pallial song nuclei important for vocal plasticity, LMAN and Area X, although singing did induce IEGs in these structures, as reported previously.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results are consistent with the possibility that some of the song nuclei may participate in non-vocal learning and the populations of neurons involved in the two tasks show partial overlap. These findings underscore the previously advanced notion that the specialized forebrain pre-motor nuclei controlling song evolved from circuits involved in behaviors related to feeding.},

Current research into auditory-motor interactions and the neural bases of musical rhythm perception has provided important insights for developing potential movement therapies. Specifically, neuroimaging studies show that rhythm perception activates structures within key motor networks, such as premotor and supplementary motor areas, basal ganglia and the cerebellum - many of which are compromised to varying degrees in Parkinson's disease. It thus seems likely that automatic engagement of motor areas during rhythm perception may be the connecting link between music and motor improvements in Parkinson's disease. This review seeks to describe the link, address core questions about its underlying mechanisms, and examine whether it can be utilized as a compensatory mechanism.},

abstract = {Human motor behavior is constantly adapted through the process of error-based learning. When the motor system encounters an error, its estimate about the body and environment will change, and the next movement will be immediately modified to counteract the underlying perturbation. Here, we show that a second mechanism, use-dependent learning, simultaneously changes movements to become more similar to the last movement. In three experiments, participants made reaching movements toward a horizontally elongated target, such that errors in the initial movement direction did not have to be corrected. Along this task-redundant dimension, we were able to induce use-dependent learning by passively guiding movements in a direction angled by 8 degrees from the previous direction. In a second study, we show that error-based and use-dependent learning can change motor behavior simultaneously in opposing directions by physically constraining the direction of active movements. After removal of the constraint, participants briefly exhibit an error-based aftereffect against the direction of the constraint, followed by a longer-lasting use-dependent aftereffect in the direction of the constraint. In the third experiment, we show that these two learning mechanisms together determine the solution the motor system adopts when learning a motor task.},

abstract = {The photoreceptors of the Drosophila compound eye are a classical model for studying cell fate specification. Photoreceptors (PRs) are organized in bundles of eight cells with two major types - inner PRs involved in color vision and outer PRs involved in motion detection. In wild type flies, most PRs express a single type of Rhodopsin (Rh): inner PRs express either Rh3, Rh4, Rh5 or Rh6 and outer PRs express Rh1. In outer PRs, the K(50) homeodomain protein Dve is a key repressor that acts to ensure exclusive Rh expression. Loss of Dve results in de-repression of Rhodopsins in outer PRs, and leads to a wide distribution of expression levels. To quantify these effects, we introduce an automated image analysis method to measure Rhodopsin levels at the single cell level in 3D confocal stacks. Our sensitive methodology reveals cell-specific differences in Rhodopsin distributions among the outer PRs, observed over a developmental time course. We show that Rhodopsin distributions are consistent with a two-state model of gene expression, in which cells can be in either high or basal states of Rhodopsin production. Our model identifies a significant role of post-transcriptional regulation in establishing the two distinct states. The timescale for interconversion between basal and high states is shown to be on the order of days. Our results indicate that even in the absence of Dve, the Rhodopsin regulatory network can maintain highly stable states. We propose that the role of Dve in outer PRs is to buffer against rare fluctuations in this network.},

abstract = {Natural movements are corrected in part by the generation of submovements, occurring early in a movement such that they amend an ongoing action. Submovements are associated with activity of the basal ganglia, implying a role for the structures in error correction. In parallel, the basal ganglia are linked to the generation and control of force amplitude, change, and duration. Here, we tested whether activity in human basal ganglia is associated with submovements generally, or was specific to a condition where the submovements only occurred in the face of unexpected proprioceptive error. Submovements were induced by introducing unexpected and variable viscous loads (augmenting the need for trial-specific grip forces) or by reducing target size (augmenting the need for visually guided on-line control) in a one-dimensional target-capture task. In both cases, subjects compensated for the increased task difficulty by generating corrective submovements, which were closely matched in frequency and type. Activity in the internal segment of the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus correlated strongly with the number of submovements during the viscous challenge but not with the target challenge. The effects could not be explained by kinematic differences, i.e., movement amplitude or average number of submovements. The results support a specific role for the basal ganglia in error correction under conditions of variable load where there is a need for the dynamic control of force within an ongoing movement.},

abstract = {The delta subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (A) receptor (GABA(A)R) is expressed postnatally mostly in the cerebellum, thalamus, and dentate gyrus. Previous studies in mice with a targeted disruption of the delta subunit revealed a considerable attenuation of behavioral responses to neuroactive steroids but not to other neuromodulatory drugs. Here we show that delta subunit loss leads to a concomitant reduction in hippocampal alpha4 subunit levels. These changes were accompanied by faster decay of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in dentate granule neurons of -/- mutants (decay tau = 25 ms) compared with +/+ controls (tau = 50 ms). Furthermore, the GABA(A)R-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) also decayed faster in delta-mutants (tau = 6.3 ms) than controls (tau = 7.2 ms) and had decreased frequency (controls, 10.5 Hz; mutants, 6.6 Hz). Prolongation of mIPSCs by the neuroactive steroid anesthetic, alphaxalone (1-10 microM), was smaller in delta-mutants (at 10 microM, 65{\%} increase) compared with +/+ littermates (308{\%} increase). In competition binding experiments, alphaxalone (0.03-1 microM) modulation of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding was reduced in delta-mutant brain homogenates, indicating that the decreased alphaxalone effects on mIPSCs were due to changes in the GABA(A)R protein. Faster decay of evoked IPSPs and mIPSCs in delta-mutants suggests presence of the delta subunit at both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs. Decreased synaptic and extrasynaptic inhibition likely contributes to the pro-epileptic phenotype of delta-mutants. Reduced neurosteroid sensitivity might also contribute to seizure susceptibility. While the simplest explanation is that delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs represent the actual target of neurosteroids, it is possible that the behavioral and physiological sensitivity to neuroactive steroids is indirectly altered in the delta -/- mice.},

Determining the physiological substrate of such effects has proven elusive owing to the low spatial resolution of conventional human neuroimaging techniques compared to the size of orientation columns in visual cortex. Here we show that even at conventional resolutions it is possible to use fMRI to obtain a direct measure of orientation-selective processing in V1. We found that many parts of V1 show subtle but reproducible biases to oriented stimuli, and that we could accumulate this information across the whole of V1 using multivariate pattern recognition. Using this information, we could then successfully predict which one of two oriented stimuli a participant was viewing, even when masking rendered that stimulus invisible. Our findings show that conventional fMRI can be used to reveal feature-selective processing in human cortex, even for invisible stimuli.},

Like other songbirds, the zebra finch communicates through learned vocalizations, an ability otherwise documented only in humans and a few other animals and lacking in the chicken-the only bird with a sequenced genome until now. Here we present a structural, functional and comparative analysis of the genome sequence of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), which is a songbird belonging to the large avian order Passeriformes. We find that the overall structures of the genomes are similar in zebra finch and chicken, but they differ in many intrachromosomal rearrangements, lineage-specific gene family expansions, the number of long-terminal-repeat-based retrotransposons, and mechanisms of sex chromosome dosage compensation. We show that song behaviour engages gene regulatory networks in the zebra finch brain, altering the expression of long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, transcription factors and their targets. We also show evidence for rapid molecular evolution in the songbird lineage of genes that are regulated during song experience. These results indicate an active involvement of the genome in neural processes underlying vocal communication and identify potential genetic substrates for the evolution and regulation of this behaviour.},

abstract = {Long-term memories are thought to depend upon the coordinated activation of a broad network of cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, the distributed nature of this representation has made it challenging to define the neural elements of the memory trace, and lesion and electrophysiological approaches provide only a narrow window into what is appreciated a much more global network. Here we used a global mapping approach to identify networks of brain regions activated following recall of long-term fear memories in mice. Analysis of Fos expression across 84 brain regions allowed us to identify regions that were co-active following memory recall. These analyses revealed that the functional organization of long-term fear memories depends on memory age and is altered in mutant mice that exhibit premature forgetting. Most importantly, these analyses indicate that long-term memory recall engages a network that has a distinct thalamic-hippocampal-cortical signature. This network is concurrently integrated and segregated and therefore has small-world properties, and contains hub-like regions in the prefrontal cortex and thalamus that may play privileged roles in memory expression.},

abstract = {The development and evolution of eyes is an "old problem" in biology, which required a special treatment in Charles Darwin's "Origin of the species" (1882) under the heading of "Difficulties of the theory". Darwin postulated a simple and imperfect eye, as a prototype, which can vary and evolve under natural selection into more complex and perfect eyes. Based upon morphological criteria and the different modes of development of the different kinds of eyes, neodarwinists have postulated that the various eye-types are polyphyletic in origin and that the eyes have evolved independently in the various animal phyla. Recent developmental genetic experiments and molecular phylogenetic analyses cast serious doubts on this interpretation and argue strongly for a monophyletic origin of the eyes from a Darwinian prototype and subsequent divergent, parallel and convergent evolution leading to the various eye-types.},

abstract = {The sensorimotor neurons found in the song-system nuclei are responsive to the sounds of the bird's own song. This selectivity emerges during vocal learning and appears to follow the development of the bird's song vocalization in two ways: at each stage, the neurons are most selective for the bird's current vocalizations and this selectivity increases as the bird learns to produce a stable adult song. Also, because of their location in the sensori-vocal pathway and because their physiological properties are correlated with the motor program, it is postulated that these neurons play a crucial role in interpreting the auditory feedback during song to preserve a desirable vocal output. The neurons found in presynaptic auditory areas lack this selectivity for the bird's own song. Auditory neurons in the secondary auditory areas caudal nidopallium and caudal mesopallium show specific responses to familiar songs or behaviorally relevant songs. These auditory areas might therefore be involved in perceptual tasks. Neurons in the primary forebrain auditory area are selective for the spectrotemporal modulations that are common in song, yielding an efficient neural representation of those sounds. Neurons that are particularly selective for the tutor song at the end of the sensory period have not yet been described in any areas. Although these three levels of selectivity found in the primary auditory forebrain areas, the secondary auditory forebrain areas, and the song system suggest a form of hierarchical sensory processing, the functional connectivity between these areas and the mechanisms generating the specific selectivity for songs that are behaviorally relevant or crucial in song learning and production have yet to be revealed.},

abstract = {Perception of the temporal structure of acoustic signals contributes critically to vocal signaling. In the aquatic clawed frog Xenopus laevis, calls differ primarily in the temporal parameter of click rate, which conveys sexual identity and reproductive state. We show here that an ensemble of auditory neurons in the laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis (TS) of X. laevis specializes in encoding vocalization click rates. We recorded single TS units while pure tones, natural calls, and synthetic clicks were presented directly to the tympanum via a vibration-stimulation probe. Synthesized click rates ranged from 4 to 50 Hz, the rate at which the clicks begin to overlap. Frequency selectivity and temporal processing were characterized using response-intensity curves, temporal-discharge patterns, and autocorrelations of reduplicated responses to click trains. Characteristic frequencies ranged from 140 to 3,250 Hz, with minimum thresholds of -90 dB re 1 mm/s at 500 Hz and -76 dB at 1,100 Hz near the dominant frequency of female clicks. Unlike units in the auditory nerve and dorsal medullary nucleus, most toral units respond selectively to the behaviorally relevant temporal feature of the rate of clicks in calls. The majority of neurons (85{\%}) were selective for click rates, and this selectivity remained unchanged over sound levels 10 to 20 dB above threshold. Selective neurons give phasic, tonic, or adapting responses to tone bursts and click trains. Some algorithms that could compute temporally selective receptive fields are described.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have examined sleep's influence on a range of hippocampus-dependent declarative memory tasks, from text learning to spatial navigation. In this study, we examined the impact of sleep, wake, and time-of-day influences on the processing of declarative information with strong semantic links (semantically related word pairs) and information requiring the formation of novel associations (unrelated word pairs). Participants encoded a set of related or unrelated word pairs at either 9 am or 9 pm, and were then tested after an interval of 30 min, 12 hr, or 24 hr. The time of day at which subjects were trained had no effect on training performance or initial memory of either word pair type. At 12 hr retest, memory overall was superior following a night of sleep compared to a day of wakefulness. However, this performance difference was a result of a pronounced deterioration in memory for unrelated word pairs across wake; there was no sleep-wake difference for related word pairs. At 24 hr retest, with all subjects having received both a full night of sleep and a full day of wakefulness, we found that memory was superior when sleep occurred shortly after learning rather than following a full day of wakefulness. Lastly, we present evidence that the rate of deterioration across wakefulness was significantly diminished when a night of sleep preceded the wake period compared to when no sleep preceded wake, suggesting that sleep served to stabilize the memories against the deleterious effects of subsequent wakefulness. Overall, our results demonstrate that 1) the impact of 12 hr of waking interference on memory retention is strongly determined by word-pair type, 2) sleep is most beneficial to memory 24 hr later if it occurs shortly after learning, and 3) sleep does in fact stabilize declarative memories, diminishing the negative impact of subsequent wakefulness.},

The location of this overlap suggests that language and tool use share computational principles for processing complex hierarchical structures common to these two abilities. The involvement of monkeys' homologous region during tool use suggests that neural processes for computation of complex hierarchical structures exist in primates without language, and could have been exapted to support human grammatical ability.},

The specific aims of this study were (a) to determine developmental functions in both control components across the lifespan; and (b) to examine whether age-related changes in these components are influenced by verbal prompts during task preparation. The results revealed an inverted u-shaped developmental function for the ability to select between task sets but not for the ability to switch between task sets. In contrast to younger adults and children, older adults generally benefited from verbalizations during task preparation. Children, but not older adults, showed a facilitation of task execution when verbal prompts were task-compatible. Conversely, older adults, but not children, showed stronger interference when verbal prompts are task-incompatible. Our findings suggest that inner speech in an important modulator of developmental changes in executive functioning across the lifespan.},

Analyses demonstrated a significant interaction between lateralized unimanual actions and target animacy and a right-hand bias for actions directed toward inanimate targets.

One suggestion is that auditory and visual stimuli are initially timed by different mechanisms, but later converted into some common duration code which is amodal. The present study investigated this using a temporal generalization interference paradigm. In test blocks, people decided whether comparison durations were or were not a 400-ms standard on average. Test blocks alternated with interference blocks where durations were systematically shorter or longer than in test blocks, and interference was found, in the direction of the durations in the interference blocks, even when the interfering blocks used stimuli in a different modality from the test block. This provides what may be the first direct experimental evidence for a "common code" for durations initially presented in different modalities at some level of the human timing system.},

abstract = {The cerebellum, like most sensorimotor areas of the brain, receives a serotonergic innervation from neurons of the reticular formation. It is well established that local application of serotonin modulates the firing rate of cerebellar Purkinje cells in vivo and in vitro, but the mechanisms by which serotonin affects the cerebellar function are still poorly understood. Whereas interactions between serotonin, glutamate, and GABA have been reported to increase or decrease the firing frequency of Purkinje cells, there is little evidence for a modulation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses by serotonin in the cerebellar cortex. Changes in the intrinsic electrical properties of Purkinje cells upon application of serotonin have also been reported, but their impact on Purkinje cell firing is unclear. The recent finding that serotonin specifically modulates the activity of Lugaro cells, a class of inhibitory interneurons of the cerebellar cortex, offers new insights on the action of this neuromodulator. The peculiar axonal projection and specific interneuronal targets of the Lugaro cells suggest that the action of serotonin might occur upstream of Purkinje cells through a resetting of the computational properties of the cerebellar cortex. Understanding the mechanisms of the serotonergic modulation of the cerebellar cortex is of clinical relevance, as abnormal serotonin metabolism has been observed in animal models and pathological cases of motor disorders involving the cerebellum, and as chronic intravenous administration of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a precursor of serotonin, was the first treatment shown to improve significantly cerebellar symptoms.},

abstract = {In both invertebrate and vertebrate models of synaptic plasticity, signaling via the putative "retrograde messenger" nitric oxide (NO) has been hypothesized to serve as a critical link between functional and structural alterations at pre- and postsynaptic sites. However, while in vitro models of synaptic plasticity have consistently implicated NO signaling in linking postsynaptic induction mechanisms with accompanying presynaptic changes, a convincing role of such "retrograde signaling" in mammalian memory formation has remained elusive. Using auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning, we show that synaptic plasticity and NO signaling in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) regulate the expression of the ERK-driven immediate early gene early growth response gene I (EGR-1) in regions of the auditory thalamus that are presynaptic to the LA. Further, antisense knockdown of EGR-1 in the auditory thalamus impairs both fear memory consolidation and the training-induced elevation of two presynaptically localized proteins in the LA. These findings indicate that synaptic plasticity and NO signaling in the LA during auditory fear conditioning promote alterations in ERK-driven gene expression in auditory thalamic neurons that are required for both fear memory consolidation as well as presynaptic correlates of fear memory formation in the LA, and provide general support for a role of NO as a "retrograde signal" in mammalian memory formation.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which music modifies brain function is not clear. Clinical findings indicate that music reduces blood pressure in various patients. We investigated the effect of music on blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Previous studies indicated that calcium increases brain dopamine (DA) synthesis through a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent system. Increased DA levels reduce blood pressure in SHR. In this study, we examined the effects of music on this pathway. Systolic blood pressure in SHR was reduced by exposure to Mozart's music (K.205), and the effect vanished when this pathway was inhibited. Exposure to music also significantly increased serum calcium levels and neostriatal DA levels. These results suggest that music leads to increased calcium/CaM-dependent DA synthesis in the brain, thus causing a reduction in blood pressure. Music might regulate and/or affect various brain functions through dopaminergic neurotransmission, and might therefore be effective for rectification of symptoms in various diseases that involve DA dysfunction.},

abstract = {The popular go/no-go paradigm is supposed to ensure a reliable probing of response inhibition mechanisms. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have repeatedly found a large number of structures, usually including a right lateralized parieto-frontal network and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). However, it is unlikely that all these regions are directly related to the mechanism that actively suppresses the motor command. Since most go/no-go designs involve complex stimulus identification/detection processes, these activations may rather reflect the engagement of different cognitive processes that are intrinsically related and quite difficult to disentangle. The current critical review is based on repeated meta-analyses of 30 go/no-go fMRI experiments using the Activation Likelihood Estimate method to contrast studies using simple vs. complex stimuli. The results show that most of the activity typically elicited by no-go signals, including pre-SMA hemodynamic response, is actually driven by the engagement of high attentional or working memory resources, not by inhibitory processes per se. Implications for current methods and theories of inhibitory control are discussed, and new lines of inquiry are proposed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Neurons compute in part by integrating, on a time scale of milliseconds, many synaptic inputs and generating a digital output - the 'action potential' of classic electrophysiology. Recent discoveries indicate that neurons also perform a second, much slower, integration operating on a time scale of minutes or even hours. The output of this slower integration involves a pulse of gene expression which may be likened to the electrophysiological action potential. Its function, however, is not directed toward immediate transmission of a synaptic signal but rather toward the experience-dependent modification of the underlying synaptic circuitry. Commonly termed the 'immediate early gene' (IEG) response, this phenomenon is often assumed to be a necessary component of a linear, deterministic cascade of memory consolidation. Critical review of the large literature describing the phenomenon, however, leads to an alternative model of IEG function in the brain. In this alternative, IEG activation is not directed at the consolidation of memories of a specific inducing event; instead, it sets the overall gain or efficiency of memory formation and directs it to circuits engaged by behaviorally significant contexts. The net result is a sharpening of the selectivity of memory formation, a recruitment of temporally correlated associations, and an ultimate enhancement of long-term memory retrieval.

abstract = {To identify variables that affect immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the auditory telencephalon of songbirds, we developed a conditioning paradigm that trained adult male canaries to associate song with a mild shock. Learning of the association was measured by a bird's fear and avoidance responses. Birds exposed to paired song and shock were compared to yoked controls exposed to each stimulus alone or to both unpaired. Additional groups examined the effects of attention and stress, and of the novelty of the stimulus situation. In situ hybridization analysis of brain sections revealed an enhancement of ZENK expression in birds learning the association between song and shock above levels induced by song alone or yoked-unpaired song and shock. This effect was specifically seen in the caudomedial auditory telencephalon (NCM-HVCM). A comparison of the several control groups indicated that novelty of the song stimulus or of its pairing with shock were the main variables that predicted ZENK levels in NCM-HVCM. These observations are compatible with ZENK playing a role in the formation of song perceptual memories.},

abstract = {Humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. For example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by Gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. This superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. Various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. These models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. A review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. The neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. The hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [R.C. Miall, Neural Computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. By implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.},

In the current study, we intended to replicate and extend our previous results using a new and larger sample of gender-matched subjects (56 right-handed professional musicians and 56 age- and handedness-matched controls). We found a significant gender x musicianship interaction for anterior and posterior CC size; male musicians had a larger anterior CC than non-musicians, while females did not show a significant effect of musicianship. The lack of a significant effect in females may be due to a tendency for a more symmetric brain organization and a disproportionately high representation of absolute pitch (AP) musicians among females. Although a direct causal effect between musicianship and alterations in the midsagittal CC size cannot be established, it is likely that the early commencement and continuous practice of bimanual motor training serves as an external trigger that can influence midsagittal CC size through changes in the actual callosal fiber composition and in the degree of myelinization, which will have implications for interhemispheric connectivity.},

abstract = {The 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist, ritanserin, was reported to retard the acquisition of conditioned responses (CRs) during classical conditioning of the rabbit's nictitating membrane (NM) response. The present study compared the effects of ritanserin on acquisition of CRs to a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) with that of the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist, LY-53,857 and the 5-HT2A selective antagonist, MDL-11,939. All three drugs were injected at equimolar doses of 0.067, 0.67 and 6.7 micromol/kg, SC, 1 h before behavioral testing. Ritanserin and MDL-11,939 retarded CR acquisition to a tone CS, while LY-53,857 had no effect. Control experiments demonstrated that ritanserin (1 micromol/kg), MDL-11,939 (1 micromol/kg) and LY-53,857 (2 micromol/kg) had no effect on baseline responding or non-associative responding to the CS. However, both ritanserin and MDL-11,939 impaired the performance of the unconditioned NM reflex, as measured by a decrease in UR amplitudes on US alone trials, while LY-53,857 had no effect. In previously trained animals, ritanserin robustly impaired the performance of CRs, as measured by a reduced ability of the CS to elicit CRs, while the effects of LY-53,857 and MDL-11,939 were marginal. The retardation of associative learning produced by ritanserin and MDL-11,939 may have been due, at least in part, to their impairment of the NM reflex arc. Since MDL-11,939 is a highly selective 5-HT2A antagonist, the retardation of learning and impairment of UR amplitudes produced by MDL-11,939 and ritanserin may have been due to blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor. The ability of ritanserin and MDL-11,939 to produce effects on learning and performance that were opposite to that of 5-HT(2A/2C) agonists suggests that they may be acting as inverse agonists at that receptor. These results stress the importance of the serotonergic system for optimal associative learning and motor function.},

The aim of the present paper is to summarize empirical findings from music cognition research that are relevant to three prominent music theoretic domains: rhythm, melody, and tonality. Attention is paid to how cognitive processes like category formation, stimulus grouping, and expectation can account for the music theoretic key concepts in these domains, such as beat, meter, voice, consonance. We give an overview of computational models that have been proposed in the literature for a variety of music processing tasks related to rhythm, melody, and tonality. Although the present state-of-the-art in computational modeling of music cognition definitely provides valuable resources for testing specific hypotheses and theories, we observe the need for models that integrate the various aspects of music perception and cognition into a single framework. Such models should be able to account for aspects that until now have only rarely been addressed in computational models of music cognition, like the active nature of perception and the development of cognitive capacities from infancy to adulthood.},

In nonhuman primates, the system provides for the understanding of biological action, and possibly for imitation, both prerequisites for language. I argue that language evolved from manual gestures, initially as a system of pantomime, but with gestures gradually "conventionalizing" to assume more symbolic form. The evolution of episodic memory and mental time travel, probably beginning with the genus Homo during the Pleistocene, created pressure for the system to "grammaticalize," involving the increased vocabulary necessary to refer to episodes separated in time and place from the present, constructions such as tense to refer to time itself, and the generativity to construct future (and fictional) episodes. In parallel with grammaticalization, the language medium gradually incorporated facial and then vocal elements, culminating in autonomous speech (albeit accompanied still by manual gesture) in our own species, Homo sapiens.},

abstract = {Abstracting syntactic rules is critical to human language learning. It is debated whether this ability, already present in young infants, is human- and language specific or can also be found in non-human animals, indicating it may arise from more general cognitive mechanisms. Current studies are often ambiguous and few have directly compared rule learning by humans and non-human animals. In a series of discrimination experiments, we presented zebra finches and human adults with comparable training and tests with the same artificial stimuli consisting of XYX and XXY structures, in which X and Y were zebra finch song elements. Zebra finches readily discriminated the training stimuli. Some birds also discriminated novel stimuli when these were composed of familiar element types, but none of the birds generalized the discrimination to novel element types. We conclude that zebra finches show evidence of simple rule abstraction related to positional learning, suggesting stimulus-bound generalization, but found no evidence for a more abstract rule generalization. This differed from the human adults, who categorized novel stimuli consisting of novel element types into different groups according to their structure. The limited abilities for rule abstraction in zebra finches may indicate what the precursors of more complex abstraction as found in humans may have been like.},

EF was indexed by perseverative responding on two bidimensional sorting tasks (Visually Cued Color-Shape task and Auditorily Cued Number-Numeral task), and age-related changes in EF were considered in relation to estimates of conscious vs. unconscious memory that were obtained using the process dissociation procedure (PDP). Results revealed the rise and fall of EF across the life span, with significant quadratic trends found for performance on both sorting tasks and for the conscious recollection component (C) of the PDP task. Regression analyses indicated that PDP estimates of conscious memory accounted for variation in performance on the visual sorting task, but not on the auditory sorting task. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for hierarchical models of EF and its development.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons in mammals respond to rewards and reward-predicting cues, and are thought to play an important role in learning actions or sensory cues that lead to reward. The anatomical sources of input that drive or modulate such responses are not well understood; these ultimately define the range of behavior to which dopaminergic neurons contribute. Primary rewards are not the immediate objective of all goal-directed behavior. For example, a goal of vocal learning is to imitate vocal-communication signals. Here, we demonstrate activation of dopaminergic neurons in songbirds driven by a basal ganglia region required for vocal learning, area X. Dopaminergic neurons in anesthetized zebra finches respond more strongly to the bird's own song (BOS) than to other sounds, and area X is critical for these responses. Direct pharmacological modulation of area X output, in the absence of auditory stimulation, is sufficient to bidirectionally modulate the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons. The only known pathway from song control regions to dopaminergic neurons involves a projection from area X to the ventral pallidum (VP), which in turn projects to dopaminergic regions. We show that VP neurons are spontaneously active and inhibited preferentially by BOS, suggesting that area X disinhibits dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting VP. Supporting this model, auditory-response latencies are shorter in area X than VP, and shorter in VP than dopaminergic neurons. Thus, dopaminergic neurons can be disinhibited selectively by complex sensory stimuli via input from the basal ganglia. The functional pathway we identify may allow dopaminergic neurons to contribute to vocal learning.},

abstract = {The selectivity of neurons in the zebra finch auditory forebrain for natural sounds was investigated systematically. The principal auditory forebrain area in songbirds consists of the tonotopically organized field L complex, which, by its location in the auditory processing stream, can be compared with the auditory cortex of mammals. We also recorded from a secondary auditory area, cHV. Field L and cHV are auditory processing stages that are presynaptic to the specialized song system nuclei where auditory neurons show an extremely selective response for the bird's own song, but weak response to almost any other sounds, including conspecific songs. In our study, we found that neurons in field L and cHV had stronger responses to conspecific song than to synthetic sounds that were designed to match the lower order acoustical properties of song, such as their overall power spectra and AM spectra. Such preferential responses to natural sounds cannot be explained by linear frequency tuning or simple nonlinear intensity tuning and requires linear or nonlinear spectro-temporal neuronal transfer functions tuned to the acoustical properties of song. The selectivity for conspecific songs in field L and cHV might reflect an intermediate auditory processing stage for vocalizations that then contributes to the generation of the very specific selectivity for the bird's own song seen in the postsynaptic song system.},

abstract = {Three classes of perceptual phenomena have repeatedly been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD): superior processing of fine detail (local structure), either inferior processing of overall/global structure or an ability to ignore disruptive global/contextual information, and impaired motion perception. This review evaluates the quality of the evidence bearing on these three phenomena. We argue that while superior local processing has been robustly demonstrated, conclusions about global processing cannot be definitively drawn from the experiments to date, which have generally not precluded observers using more local cues. Perception of moving stimuli is impaired in ASD, but explanations in terms of magnocellular/dorsal deficits do not appear to be sufficient. We suggest that abnormalities in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) may provide a neural basis for the range of motion-processing deficits observed in ASD, including biological motion perception. Such an explanation may also provide a link between perceptual abnormalities and specific deficits in social cognition associated with autism.},

abstract = {Synaptic plasticity directs development of the nervous system and is thought to underlie memory storage in adult animals. A great deal of our current understanding of the role of AMPA receptors in synaptic plasticity comes from studies on developing cortex and cell cultures. In the present study, we instead focus on plasticity in mature neurons in the neocortex of adult animals. We find that the glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) subunit of the AMPA receptor is involved in experience-dependent plasticity in adult cortex in vivo and that it acts in addition to neuronal nitric oxide synthase ($\alpha$NOS1), an enzyme that produces the rapid synaptic signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO). Potentiation of the spared whisker response, following single whisker experience, is ∼33{\%} less in GluR1-null mutants than in wild types. We found that the remaining plasticity depended on $\alpha$NOS1. Potentiation was reduced by {\textgreater}42{\%} in the single $\alpha$NOS1-null mutants and completely abolished in GluR1/$\alpha$NOS1 double-knock-out mice. However, potentiation in GluR1/NOS3 double knock-outs occurred at similar levels to that seen in GluR1 single knock-outs. Synaptic plasticity in the layer IV to II/III pathway in vitro mirrored the results in vivo, in that LTP was present in GluR1/NOS3 double-knock-out mice but not in the GluR1/$\alpha$NOS1 animals. While basal levels of NO in cortical slices depended on both $\alpha$NOS1 and NOS3, NMDA receptor-dependent NO release only depended on $\alpha$NOS1 and not on NOS3. These findings demonstrate that $\alpha$NOS1 acts in concert with GluR1 to produce experience-dependent plasticity in the neocortex.},

Repetition of this stimulus 10 times is sufficient to induce a maximal increase in RNA and protein, detected 30 and 90 min later respectively. Thus very brief stimuli can set in motion a slow genomic process in the brain which takes hours to resolve. Immediate-early gene function is often considered in the context of a "feedback" model (i.e., to consolidate memories of the inducing event). However, based on the long lag observed here between initiation and full expression of the molecular response, we suggest an alternative, ethologically based, "feed-forward" model in which exposure to a novel or significant context triggers an increase in the efficiency of memory capture processes for subsequent experiences.},

abstract = {Networks of GABAergic neurons are key elements in the generation of gamma oscillations in the brain. Computational studies suggested that the emergence of coherent oscillations requires hyperpolarizing inhibition. Here, we show that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition in mature interneurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus is shunting rather than hyperpolarizing. Unexpectedly, when shunting inhibition is incorporated into a structured interneuron network model with fast and strong synapses, coherent oscillations emerge. In comparison to hyperpolarizing inhibition, networks with shunting inhibition show several advantages. First, oscillations are generated with smaller tonic excitatory drive. Second, network frequencies are tuned to the gamma band. Finally, robustness against heterogeneity in the excitatory drive is markedly improved. In single interneurons, shunting inhibition shortens the interspike interval for low levels of drive but prolongs it for high levels, leading to homogenization of neuronal firing rates. Thus, shunting inhibition may confer increased robustness to gamma oscillations in the brain.},

abstract = {The capacity of the human brain to detect deviance in the acoustic environment pre-attentively is reflected in a brain event-related potential (ERP), mismatch negativity (MMN). MMN is observed in response to the presentation of rare oddball sounds that deviate from an otherwise regular pattern of frequent background standard sounds. While the primate and cat auditory cortex (AC) exhibit MMN-like activity, it is unclear whether the rodent AC produces a deviant response that reflects deviance detection in a background of regularities evident in recent auditory stimulus history or differential adaptation of neuronal responses due to rarity of the deviant sound. We examined whether MMN-like activity occurs in epidural AC potentials in awake and anesthetized rats to high and low frequency and long and short duration deviant sounds. ERPs to deviants were compared with ERPs to common standards and also with ERPs to deviants when interspersed with many different standards to control for background regularity effects. High frequency (HF) and long duration deviant ERPs in the awake rat showed evidence of deviance detection, consisting of negative displacements of the deviant ERP relative to ERPs to both common standards and deviants with many standards. The HF deviant MMN-like response was also sensitive to the extent of regularity in recent acoustic stimulation. Anesthesia in contrast resulted in positive displacements of deviant ERPs. Our results suggest that epidural MMN-like potentials to HF sounds in awake rats encode deviance in an analogous manner to the human MMN, laying the foundation for animal models of disorders characterized by disrupted MMN generation, such as schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The proper functioning of the adult mammalian brain relies on the orchestrated regulation of neural activity by a diverse population of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons. Until recently, our appreciation of GABA-mediated inhibition focused predominantly on the GABA(A) (GABA type A) receptors located at synaptic contacts, which are activated in a transient or 'phasic' manner by GABA that is released from synaptic vesicles. However, there is growing evidence that low concentrations of ambient GABA can persistently activate certain subtypes of GABA(A) receptor, which are often remote from synapses, to generate a 'tonic' conductance. In this review, we consider the distinct roles of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptor subtypes in the control of neuronal excitability.},

abstract = {Tonic inhibition is a key regulator of neuronal excitability and network function in the brain, but its role in sensory information processing remains poorly understood. The cerebellum is a favorable model system for addressing this question as granule cells, which form the input layer of the cerebellar cortex, permit high-resolution patch-clamp recordings in vivo, and are the only neurons in the cerebellar cortex that express the $\alpha$6$\delta$-containing GABA(A) receptors mediating tonic inhibition. We investigated how tonic inhibition regulates sensory information transmission in the rat cerebellum by using a combination of intracellular recordings from granule cells and molecular layer interneurons in vivo, selective pharmacology, and in vitro dynamic clamp experiments. We show that blocking tonic inhibition significantly increases the spontaneous firing rate of granule cells while only moderately increasing sensory-evoked spike output. In contrast, enhancing tonic inhibition reduces the spike probability in response to sensory stimulation with minimal effect on the spontaneous spike rate. Both manipulations result in a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio of sensory transmission in granule cells and of parallel fiber synaptic input to downstream molecular layer interneurons. These results suggest that under basal conditions the level of tonic inhibition in vivo enhances the fidelity of sensory information transmission through the input layer of the cerebellar cortex.},

abstract = {Synchronised neuronal oscillations at beta frequencies are prevalent in the human motor system, but their function is unclear. In this Opinion article, we propose that the levels of beta oscillations provide a measure of the likelihood that a new voluntary action will need to be actuated. Oscillatory beta activity is in turn modulated by net dopamine levels at sites of cortical input to the basal ganglia. We hypothesise that net dopamine levels are modulated in response to salient internal and external cues. Crucially, the resulting modulation of beta activity is predictive, enabling the appropriate prospective resourcing and preparation of potential actions. Loss of dopamine, as in Parkinson's disease, annuls this function, unless net dopaminergic activity can be elevated through medication.},

abstract = {The dawn of chemical neuroanatomy in the CNS came with the discovery and mapping of the central dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons by means of transmitter histochemistry using the Falck-Hillarp formaldehyde fluorescence technique in the early 1960s. Our mapping of the central monoamine neurons was continued and further established with tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in collaboration with Menek Goldstein and Tomas H{\"{o}}kfelt. During recent years an evolutionary constraint in the nuclear parcellation of the DA, NA and 5-HT neurons was demonstrated in the order Rodentia and other mammals. The abundant existence of global monoamine varicose nerve terminal networks synthesizing, storing and releasing monoamines in various parts of the CNS, including the release of DA by tubero-infundibular DA neurons as a prolactin inhibitory factor from the external layer of the median eminence into the portal vessels and the appearance of extraneuronal DA fluorescence after, e.g., treatment with amphetamine in nialamide pretreated rats (Falck-Hillarp technique) were also remarkable observations. These observations and others like the discovery of transmitter-receptor mismatches opened up the possibility that monoamines were modulating the wired brain, built up mainly by glutamate and GABA neurons, through diffusion and flow in the extracellular fluid of the extracellular space and in the CSF. This transmission also involved long-distance channels along myelinated fibers and blood vessels and was called volume transmission (VT). The extracellular space (ECS), filled with a 3D matrix, plays a fundamental role in this communication. Energy gradients for signal migration in the ECS are produced via concentration, temperature and pressure gradients, the latter two allowing a flow of the ECF and CSF carrying the VT signals. The differential properties of the wiring transmission (WT) and VT circuits and communication channels will be discussed as well as the role of neurosteroids and oxytocin receptors in volume transmission leading to a new understanding of the integrative actions of neuronal-glial networks. The role of tunneling nanotubes with mitochondrial transfer in CNS inter alia as part of neuron-glia interactions will also be introduced representing a novel type of wiring transmission. The impact of the technicolour approach to the connectome for the future characterization of the wired networks of the brain is emphasized.},

@article{Tokarev2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specialized neural pathways, the song system, are required for acquiring, producing, and perceiving learned avian vocalizations. Birds that do not learn to produce their vocalizations lack telencephalic song system components. It is not known whether the song system forebrain regions are exclusively evolved for song or whether they also process information not related to song that might reflect their 'evolutionary history'.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this question we monitored the induction of two immediate-early genes (IEGs) c-Fos and ZENK in various regions of the song system in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in response to an aversive food learning paradigm; this involves the association of a food item with a noxious stimulus that affects the oropharyngeal-esophageal cavity and tongue, causing subsequent avoidance of that food item. The motor response results in beak and head movements but not vocalizations. IEGs have been extensively used to map neuro-molecular correlates of song motor production and auditory processing. As previously reported, neurons in two pallial vocal motor regions, HVC and RA, expressed IEGs after singing. Surprisingly, c-Fos was induced equivalently also after food aversion learning in the absence of singing. The density of c-Fos positive neurons was significantly higher than that of birds in control conditions. This was not the case in two other pallial song nuclei important for vocal plasticity, LMAN and Area X, although singing did induce IEGs in these structures, as reported previously.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results are consistent with the possibility that some of the song nuclei may participate in non-vocal learning and the populations of neurons involved in the two tasks show partial overlap. These findings underscore the previously advanced notion that the specialized forebrain pre-motor nuclei controlling song evolved from circuits involved in behaviors related to feeding.},

Birds that were isolated from their father at 25 days (group A) did not show a preference for their father's song whereas those isolated from the father at 35 days (groups B and C) learnt to prefer their father's song. In addition, group C, which were housed with tutor 1 from 35 to 70 days and with tutor 2 from 4 to 6 months of age, preferred their tutors' songs to those of other males. If one compares the strength of preference in the two types of test, group B showed a weaker preference for the father in tests with the father and a similar male. Further, group C showed a weaker preference in the test with tutor 1 versus a similar male. The possible influence of tutor, sibling and own song on the discrimination of the father's song is discussed, and the results are compared with those for song performance learning. Finally, the mother birds preferred their mate's song. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

Determining which regions show preferential responsiveness to the bird's own song (BOS) is of great importance because neurons sensitive to self-generated vocalisations could mediate this auditory feedback process. Neurons in the song nuclei and in a secondary auditory area, the caudal medial mesopallium (CMM), show selective responses to the BOS.

This olfactory-auditory interaction appeared naturally in lactating mothers shortly after parturition and was long lasting. Naive virgins that had experience with the pups also showed an appearance of olfactory-auditory integration in A1, suggesting that multisensory integration may be experience dependent. Neurons from lactating mothers were more sensitive to sounds as compared to those from experienced mice, independent of the odor effects. These uni- and multisensory cortical changes may facilitate the detection and discrimination of pup distress calls and strengthen the bond between mothers and their neonates. VIDEO ABSTRACT:},

Beat induction, the detection of a regular pulse in an auditory signal, is considered a fundamental human trait that, arguably, played a decisive role in the origin of music. Theorists are divided on the issue whether this ability is innate or learned. We show that newborn infants develop expectation for the onset of rhythmic cycles (the downbeat), even when it is not marked by stress or other distinguishing spectral features. Omitting the downbeat elicits brain activity associated with violating sensory expectations. Thus, our results strongly support the view that beat perception is innate.},

abstract = {The song nucleus high vocal center (HVC) sends neural signals for song production and receives auditory input. By using electroencephalography (EEG) to objectively identify wake/sleep state, we show that HVC auditory responses change with physiological states. Comparison of EEG and HVC records revealed that HVC response to auditory stimuli is greatest during slow-wave sleep. During slow-wave sleep, HVC neurons responded preferentially to the bird's own song. Strikingly, both spontaneous and forced waking during sleep caused HVC auditory responses to cease within milliseconds of an EEG-measured state change. State-dependent phenomena in downstream nuclei, such as robustus archistriatalis, are likely to be derivatives of those in HVC.},

abstract = {Understanding how the brain extracts and combines temporal structure (rhythm) information from events presented to different senses remains unresolved. Many neuroimaging beat perception studies have focused on the auditory domain and show the presence of a highly regular beat (isochrony) in "auditory" stimulus streams enhances neural responses in a distributed brain network and affects perceptual performance. Here, we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements of brain activity while healthy human participants performed a visual task on isochronous versus randomly timed "visual" streams, with or without concurrent task-irrelevant sounds. We found that visual detection of higher intensity oddball targets was better for isochronous than randomly timed streams, extending previous auditory findings to vision. The impact of isochrony on visual target sensitivity correlated positively with fMRI signal changes not only in visual cortex but also in auditory sensory cortex during audiovisual presentations. Visual isochrony activated a similar timing-related brain network to that previously found primarily in auditory beat perception work. Finally, activity in multisensory left posterior superior temporal sulcus increased specifically during concurrent isochronous audiovisual presentations. These results indicate that regular isochronous timing can modulate visual processing and this can also involve multisensory audiovisual brain mechanisms.},

abstract = {Two broad hypotheses have been advanced to explain the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. One is that stimulation inactivates STN neurons, producing a functional lesion. The other is that electrical stimulation activates the STN output, thus "jamming" pathological activity in basal ganglia-corticothalamic circuits. Evidence consistent with both concepts has been adduced from modeling and animal studies, as well as from recordings in patients. However, the stimulation parameters used in many recording studies have not been well matched to those used clinically. In this study, we recorded STN activity in patients with Parkinson's disease during stimulation delivered through a clinical DBS electrode using standard therapeutic stimulus parameters. A microelectrode was used to record the firing of a single STN neuron during DBS (3-5 V, 80-200 Hz, 90- to 200-micros pulses; 33 neurons/11 patients). Firing rate was unchanged during the stimulus trains, and the recorded neurons did not show prolonged (s) changes in firing rate on termination of the stimulation. However, a brief (approximately 1 ms), short-latency (6 ms) postpulse inhibition was seen in 10 of 14 neurons analyzed. A subset of neurons displayed altered firing patterns, with a predominant shift toward random firing. These data do not support the idea that DBS inactivates the STN and are instead more consistent with the hypothesis that this stimulation provides a null signal to basal ganglia-corticothalamic circuitry that has been altered as part of Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) assembled of different subunits mediate tonic and phasic inhibition in hippocampal neurons. CA1/CA3 pyramidal cells (PCs) predominantly express alpha5 subunits whereas dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) and molecular layer (ML) interneurons predominantly express delta subunits. Both alpha5- and delta-containing GABA(A)Rs mediate tonic inhibition. We have shown previously that mice lacking alpha5 subunits (Gabra5-/-) have a residual tonic current in CA1/CA3 PCs because of an upregulation of delta subunits, but the basis of the residual tonic current in DGGCs and ML interneurons of mice lacking the delta subunit (Gabrd-/-) is still unknown. We now show that wild-type DGGCs have a small tonic current mediated by alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs responsible for approximately 29{\%} of the total tonic current. To better identify the GABA(A)Rs mediating tonic inhibition in hippocampal neurons, we generated mice lacking both alpha5 and delta subunits (Gabra5/Gabrd-/-). Recordings from CA1/CA3 PCs, DGGCs, and ML interneurons in these mice show an absence of tonic currents without compensatory changes in spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs), sEPSCs, and membrane resistance. The absence of tonic inhibition results in spontaneous gamma oscillations recordable in vitro in the CA3 pyramidal layer of these mice, which can be mimicked in wild-type mice by blocking alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs with 50 nM L-655,708. In conclusion, depending on the cell type, the alpha5 and delta subunits are the principal GABA(A)R subunits responsible for mediating the lion's share of tonic inhibition in hippocampal neurons.},

abstract = {GABA acts on GABA(A) receptors to evoke both phasic inhibitory synaptic events and persistent, tonic currents. The gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor is involved in both phasic and tonic signaling in the hippocampus. Several mutations of this subunit are linked to human epileptic syndromes with febrile seizures, yet it is not clear how they perturb neuronal activity. Here, we examined the expression and functional impact of recombinant gamma2 in hippocampal neurons. We show that the K289M mutation has no effect on membrane trafficking and synaptic aggregation of recombinant gamma2, but accelerates the decay of synaptic currents. In contrast, the R43Q mutation primarily reduces surface expression of recombinant gamma2. However, it has no dominant effect on synaptic currents but instead reduces tonic GABA currents, at least in part by reducing surface expression of the alpha5 subunit. Our data suggests that the phenotypic specificity of mutations affecting the GABA(A) receptor gamma2 gene may result from different actions specific to distinct modes of GABAergic signaling.},

abstract = {Using the proboscis extension response we conditioned pollen and nectar foragers of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) to tactile patterns under laboratory conditions. Pollen foragers demonstrated better acquisition, extinction, and reversal learning than nectar foragers. We tested whether the known differences in response thresholds to sucrose between pollen and nectar foragers could explain the observed differences in learning and found that nectar foragers with low response thresholds performed better during acquisition and extinction than ones with higher thresholds. Conditioning pollen and nectar foragers with similar response thresholds did not yield differences in their learning performance. These results suggest that differences in the learning performance of pollen and nectar foragers are a consequence of differences in their perception of sucrose. Furthermore, we analysed the effect which the perception of sucrose reward has on associative learning. Nectar foragers with uniform low response thresholds were conditioned using varying concentrations of sucrose. We found significant positive correlations between the concentrations of the sucrose rewards and the performance during acquisition and extinction. The results are summarised in a model which describes the relationships between learning performance, response threshold to sucrose, concentration of sucrose and the number of rewards.},

We studied the acquisition of instrumental responding in healthy human volunteers in a task in which we orthogonalized action requirements and outcome valence. Subjects were much more successful in learning active choices in rewarded conditions, and passive choices in punished conditions. Using computational reinforcement-learning models, we teased apart contributions from putatively instrumental and Pavlovian components in the generation of the observed asymmetry during learning. Moreover, using model-based fMRI, we showed that BOLD signals in striatum and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) correlated with instrumentally learnt action values, but with opposite signs for go and no-go choices. Finally, we showed that successful instrumental learning depends on engagement of bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Our behavioral and computational data showed that instrumental learning is contingent on overcoming inherent and plastic Pavlovian biases, while our neuronal data showed this learning is linked to unique patterns of brain activity in regions implicated in action and inhibition respectively. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {As a chemical transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, nitric oxide (NO) is still thought a bit of an oddity, yet this role extends back to the beginnings of the evolution of the nervous system, predating many of the more familiar neurotransmitters. During the 20 years since it became known, evidence has accumulated for NO subserving an increasing number of functions in the mammalian central nervous system, as anticipated from the wide distribution of its synthetic and signal transduction machinery within it. This review attempts to probe beneath those functions and consider the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which NO evokes short- and long-term modifications in neural performance. With any transmitter, understanding its receptors is vital for decoding the language of communication. The receptor proteins specialised to detect NO are coupled to cGMP formation and provide an astonishing degree of amplification of even brief, low amplitude NO signals. Emphasis is given to the diverse ways in which NO receptor activation initiates changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic strength by acting at pre- and/or postsynaptic locations. Signalling to non-neuronal cells and an unexpected line of communication between endothelial cells and brain cells are also covered. Viewed from a mechanistic perspective, NO conforms to many of the rules governing more conventional neurotransmission, particularly of the metabotropic type, but stands out as being more economical and versatile, attributes that presumably account for its spectacular evolutionary success.},

abstract = {—Mitochondria are central for various cellular processes that include ATP production, intracellular Ca 2ϩ signaling, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Neurons critically depend on mitochondrial function to establish membrane excitability and to execute the complex processes of neuro-transmission and plasticity. While much information about mitochondrial proper-ties is available from studies on isolated mitochondria and dissociated cell cultures, less is known about mitochondrial function in intact neurons in brain tissue. However, a detailed description of the interactions between mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and neuronal activity is crucial for the understanding of the complex physiological behavior of neurons, as well as the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases. The combination of new fluorescence imaging techniques, electrophysiology, and brain slice preparations provides a powerful tool to study mitochondrial function during neuronal activity, with high spatiotemporal resolution. This review summarizes recent findings on mitochondrial Ca 2ϩ trans-port, mitochondrial membrane potential (⌬⌿ m), and energy metabolism during neuronal activity. We will first discuss interactions of these parameters for exper-imental stimulation conditions that can be related to the physiological range. We will then describe how mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction develops during pathological neuronal activity, focusing on temporal lobe epilepsy and its experi-mental models. The aim is to illustrate that 1) the structure of the mitochondrial compartment is highly dynamic in neurons, 2) there is a fine-tuned coupling between neuronal activity and mitochondrial function, and 3) mitochondria are of central importance for the complex behavior of neurons. brain slice preparation; electrophysiology; NADH; mitochondrial calcium trans-port; temporal lobe epilepsy MITOCHONDRIA ARE UNIQUE ORGANELLES providing the host cell with ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria are also central to intracellular Ca 2ϩ homeostasis, steroid synthesis, generation of free radical species, and forms of apoptotic cell death. As a consequence, mitochondrial dysfunction has dev-astating effects on the integrity of cells and may thus be critically involved in aging, metabolic and degenerative dis-eases, as well as cancer in higher organisms and humans (218). Most of the studies on mitochondrial function have been conducted in preparations of isolated mitochondria and disso-ciated cultures of excitable and nonexcitable cells. Data from these studies have been summarized and discussed in a variety of excellent general reviews on mitochondrial genetics, bio-chemistry, physiology, and pathology, characterizing mito-chondria as a highly dynamic, sensitive, but potentially harm-ful entity (15, 24, 55, 80, 145, 179). The central nervous system (CNS) has an extraordinary high metabolic rate, as it consumes about 20{\%} of oxygen inspired at rest, while accounting for only 2{\%} of the body weight (199). This immense metabolic demand is because neurons are highly differentiated cells that need large amounts of ATP for main-tenance of ionic gradients across the cell membranes and for neurotransmission. Since most neuronal ATP is generated by oxidative metabolism, neurons critically depend on mitochon-drial function and oxygen supply (1, 60, 144). Conversely, neuronal function and survival are very sensitive to mitochon-drial dysfunction (62, 158). The second important aspect is the functional heterogeneity in neuronal segments, which is also reflected by the complex morphology of neurons, which can extend over hundreds of micrometers, depending on neuronal cell type and brain region. Accordingly, dendritic, somatic, axonal, and presynaptic segments of neurons might have quite different energy demands, which require local adaptation of energy supply, as well as local cellular signals interconnecting neuronal and mitochondrial metabolic activity. For these rea-sons, the detailed description of the interplay between mito-chondrial function, energy metabolism, and neuronal activity is of critical importance for understanding of neuronal physiol-ogy and pathophysiology in various neurological diseases (101, 187, 193). However, the exploration of this interplay in intact animals is aggravated by a variety of factors, like restriction of investigations to cortices of cerebrum and cere-bellum, limited control over stimulation parameters, compli-cated recording conditions (e.g., dye loading with fluorescence indicators), as well as artifacts resulting from breathing and changes in blood flow in vivo. To bypass these limitations, most of the recent studies in the field have been performed in vitro. The isolated nerve terminal (synaptosome preparation) is very suitable for exploring mitochondrial bioenergetics in a physiological milieu, and dissociated neuronal cell cultures},

abstract = {In three experiments, participants listened for a target's pitch change within recurrent nine-tone patterns having largely isochronous rhythms. Patterns differed in pitch structure of initial (context) and final (target distance) pattern segments. Also varied were: probe timing (Experiments 2 and 3) and instructions about probe timing (Experiments 2 and 3). In all experiments, identification of a recurrent target was poorer in patterns with wider context pitch intervals (in semitones) than in others. Effects of probe timing also occurred, with better performance for temporally expected than unexpected probes. However, when listeners were explicitly told to focus upon a target's pitch and not its timing (Experiment 3), they performed selectively better in patterns with smaller target/probe pitch distances, especially for rhythmically expected probes. Five theoretical approaches to the respective roles of pitch and/or time structure were assessed. Although no single approach accounted for all results, a modification of one theory (a Pitch/Time Entrainment model) provided a reasonable description of findings.},

@article{Phillips-Silver2011,
abstract = {Humans move to the beat of music. Despite the ubiquity and early emergence of this response, some individuals report being unable to feel the beat in music. We report a sample of people without special training, all of whom were proficient at perceiving and producing the musical beat with the exception of one case ("Mathieu"). Motion capture and psychophysical tests revealed that people synchronized full-body motion to music and detected when a model dancer was not in time with the music. In contrast, Mathieu failed to period- and phase-lock his movement to the beat of most music pieces, and failed to detect most asynchronies of the model dancer. Mathieu's near-normal synchronization with a metronome suggests that the deficit concerns beat finding in the context of music. These results point to time as having a distinct neurobiological origin from pitch in music processing.},

@article{Wawersik2000,
abstract = {Pax6, a member of the paired-box family of transcription factors, is critical for oculogenesis in both vertebrates and insects. Identification of potential vertebrate Pax6 targets has been guided by studies in Drosophila, where the Pax6 homologs eyeless ( ey ) and twin of eyeless ( toy ) function within a network of genes that synergistically pattern the developing fly eye. These targets, which share homology with the fly genes sine oculis, eyes absent and dachshund, exist in mice and humans as the Six, Eya and Dach gene families. Members of these gene families are present in the developing vertebrate eye, and preliminary studies suggest that they may function in a network analogous to that in the fly. Thus, despite radically different architecture, a similar molecular scaffold underlies both vertebrate and fly eye patterning, suggesting that the considerable power of Drosophila genetics can be harnessed to study mammalian ocular development.},

@article{Contestabile2012,
abstract = {More than 20 years of research have firmly established important roles of the diffusible messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO), in cerebellar development and function. Granule neurons are main players in every NO-related mechanism involving cerebellar function and dysfunction. Granule neurons are endowed with remarkable amounts of the Ca(2+)-dependent neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase and can directly respond to endogenously produced NO or induce responses in neighboring cells taking advantage of the high diffusibility of the molecule. Nitric oxide acts as a negative regulator of granule cell precursor proliferation and promotes survival and differentiation of these neurons. Nitric oxide is neuroprotective towards granule neurons challenged with toxic insults. Nitric oxide is a main regulator of bidirectional plasticity at parallel fiber-Purkinje neuron synapses, inducing long-term depression (LTD) or long-term potentiation (LTP) depending on postsynaptic Ca(2+) levels, thus playing a central role in cerebellar learning related to motor control. Granule neurons cooperate with glial cells, in particular with microglia, in the regulation of NO production through the respective forms of NOS present in the two cellular types. Aim of the present paper is to review the state of the art and the improvement of our understanding of NO functions in cerebellar granule neurons obtained during the last two decades and to outline possible future development of the research.},

@article{Imaizumi2010,
abstract = {A central goal in auditory neuroscience is to understand the neural coding of species-specific communication and human speech sounds. Low-rate repetitive sounds are elemental features of communication sounds, and core auditory cortical regions have been implicated in processing these information-bearing elements. Repetitive sounds could be encoded by at least three neural response properties: 1) the event-locked spike-timing precision, 2) the mean firing rate, and 3) the interspike interval (ISI). To determine how well these response aspects capture information about the repetition rate stimulus, we measured local group responses of cortical neurons in cat anterior auditory field (AAF) to click trains and calculated their mutual information based on these different codes. ISIs of the multiunit responses carried substantially higher information about low repetition rates than either spike-timing precision or firing rate. Combining firing rate and ISI codes was synergistic and captured modestly more repetition information. Spatial distribution analyses showed distinct local clustering properties for each encoding scheme for repetition information indicative of a place code. Diversity in local processing emphasis and distribution of different repetition rate codes across AAF may give rise to concurrent feed-forward processing streams that contribute differently to higher-order sound analysis.},

This concept suggests that astrocytes, together with pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements, make up a functional synapse. Astrocyte release of gliotransmitters (for example, glutamate and adenosine triphosphate) is generally accepted to be a Ca2+-dependent process. We used two mouse lines to either selectively increase or obliterate astrocytic Gq G protein-coupled receptor Ca2+ signaling to further test the hypothesis that astrocytes release gliotransmitters in a Ca2+-dependent manner to affect synaptic transmission. Neither increasing nor obliterating astrocytic Ca2+ fluxes affects spontaneous and evoked excitatory synaptic transmission or synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest that, at least in the hippocampus, the mechanisms of gliotransmission need to be reconsidered.},

abstract = {How do social interactions form and modulate the neural representations of specific complex signals? This question can be addressed in the songbird auditory system. Like humans, songbirds learn to vocalize by imitating tutors heard during development. These learned vocalizations are important in reproductive and social interactions and in individual recognition. As a model for the social reinforcement of particular songs, male zebra finches (n=11) were trained to peck for a food reward in response to one song stimulus (GO) and to withhold responding for another (NoGO). After performance reached criterion, single and multi- unit neural responses to both trained and novel stimuli were obtained from multiple electrodes inserted bilaterally into two songbird auditory processing areas (caudomedial mesopallium, CMM, and caudomedial nidopallium, NCM) of awake, restrained birds. Neurons in these areas undergo stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) to repeated song stimuli, and responses to familiar stimuli adapt more slowly than to novel stimuli. The results show that auditory responses differed in NCM and CMM for trained (GO and NoGO) stimuli versus novel song stimuli. When subjects were grouped by the number of training days required to reach criterion, fast learners showed larger neural responses and faster SSA to all stimuli than slow learners in both areas. Further, responses in NCM of fast learners were more strongly left-lateralized than in slow learners. Thus, auditory responses in these sensory areas not only encode stimulus familiarity, but also reflect behavioral reinforcement in our paradigm, and can potentially be modulated by social interactions.},

abstract = {The sound of birdsong activates robust gene expression in the caudomedial neostriatum (NCM) of songbirds. To assess the function of this genomic response, we analyzed the temporal and quantitative relationships between electrophysiological activity and gene induction. Single units in zebra finch NCM showed large increases in firing in response to birdsong, whereas simple auditory tones tended to inhibit firing. Most cells showed little selectivity for individual songs based on total number of spikes produced. When a novel song stimulus was repeated, the cells rapidly modulated their firing rates so that the first response to a stimulus was markedly higher than consecutive responses. Even after many repetitions of a particular song, cells continued to fire in response to that stimulus, unlike the complete "habituation" observed previously for genomic activity. The initial modulation of the response to a particular song disappeared, however, once that song was repeated for 200 trials ( approximately 34 min). These results indicate a dissociation between gross physiological activity and "immediate early" gene expression: genomic activity occurs only during a subset of electrophysiological responses. We propose a model in which nuclear responses in NCM are modulated by pathways distinct from the primary auditory inputs to NCM. This would account for the changing selectivity of the genomic response and implies an active role for the cell nucleus as an integrating agent in the physiological operation of neural circuits.},

abstract = {Reaction times (rts) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the sta- tistical analysis of rt data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., Forster {\&} Dickinson, 1976). Mixed- effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, {\&} Bates, 2008) does not re- quire prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical flexibility with respect to the choice of transforma- tion for the rts. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal depen- dencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of in- teractions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.},

One of these areas, the neostriatum caudolaterale (NCL) of pigeons, has been functionally compared with the mammalian prefrontal cortex (PFC) because of its prominent role in spatial delay and reversal tasks and its innervation by the dopaminergic system that modulates these functions. However, whereas the PFC maintains in working memory information of different domains, the essential role of the NCL in working memory has been demonstrated only for spatial tasks. To investigate whether the avian NCL is also crucial for nonspatial working memory functions, pigeons were tested in an object-related (color) delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) task. Bilateral lesions were placed in the entire, dorsal, or ventral NCL to test for possible functional subdivisions that were proposed to exist on the basis of neurochemical and behavioral data. Pigeons with total, dorsal, and ventral NCL lesions showed significant deficits in their DMTS performance, whereas controls were not impaired. Thus, the avian NCL is critically involved in nonspatial working memory processes. Recovery from performance deficits was observed in animals with ventral or total NCL lesions, whereas animals with dorsal NCL lesions showed no improvement. Ventral NCL may mediate perseverative behavior, whereas dorsal NCL might be involved in active working memory. Differences in the connections of these subdivisions with striatal areas and other association areas in the frontomedial forebrain underline functional differences. The data indicate a possible segregation of functions in the avian NCL.},

abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.},

In doing so they synchronise their voices and bodily movements to a shared, repeating interval of time, the musical pulse, beat or tactus. We take this capacity to "entrain" to an evenly paced stimulus (isochrony) so much for granted that it may come as a surprise to learn that from a biological point of view such behaviour is exceptional. But it is not altogether unique. There are a number of other species, none of them closely related to humans, that also engage in group synchrony of behaviour through entrainment to an isochronous pulse. Despite their evolutionary distance from us their life circumstances throw an interesting light on the possible origin and nature of our own entrainment capacity. Here we consider this capacity in terms of its possible origin, functional mechanisms, and ontogenetic development.},

abstract = {Cortical interneurons, generated predominantly in the medial ganglionic eminence, migrate around and avoid the developing striatum in the subpallium en route to the cortex. This is attributable to the chemorepulsive cues of class 3 semaphorins expressed in the striatal mantle and acting through neuropilin (Nrp1 and Nrp2) receptors expressed in these cells. Cortical interneurons also express Robo receptors, and we show here that in mice lacking Robo1, but not Robo2, these cells migrate aberrantly through the striatum. In vitro experiments demonstrated that interneurons lacking Robo1 function are significantly less responsive to the effects of semaphorins. Failure to respond to semaphorin appears to be attributable to a reduction in Nrp1 and PlexinA1 receptors within these cells. Biochemical studies further demonstrated that Robo1 binds directly to Nrp1, but not to semaphorins, and this interaction is mediated by a region contained within its first two Ig domains. Thus, we show for the first time that Robo1 interacts with Nrp1 to modulate semaphorin signaling in the developing forebrain and direct the migration of interneurons through the subpallium and into the cortex.},

Males responded by approaching the speaker, searching for an intruder and actively singing. In situ hybridization of brain sections revealed significantly higher expression of the transcriptional regulator ZENK in challenged birds than in unstimulated controls in several auditory structures and song control nuclei. We conclude that singing behavior in the context of territorial defense is associated with gene regulation in brain centers that control song perception and production, and that behaviorally regulated gene expression can be used to investigate brain areas involved in the natural behaviors of freely ranging animals.},

abstract = {The cerebellar cortex is organized by transverse foliation and longitudinal compartmentalization. Although the latter, which is recognized through the molecular expression in subsets of Purkinje cells (PCs), is closely related to topographic axonal projection and represents functional divisions, the details have not been fully clarified in mammals other than rodents. Therefore, we examined folial and compartmental organization of the marmoset cerebellum, which resembles the macaque cerebellum, and compared it with that of the rodent cerebellum by aldolase C immunostaining, three-dimensional reconstruction of the PC layer, and labeling of olivocerebellar and corticonuclear projections. Longitudinal stripes of different aldolase C expression intensities separated the entire cerebellar cortex into multiple compartments. Lobule VIIAb-d was equivalent to rodent lobule VIc in that it contained a transverse gap in the cortical layers and served as the rostrocaudal boundary for compartments and axonal branching. Olivocortical and corticonuclear projection patterns in major compartments indicated that the compartmental organization in the marmoset cerebellum was generally equivalent to that in the rodent cerebellum, although two compartments were missing in the pars intermedia and several compartments that have not been seen in rodents were recognized in the flocculus, nodulus, and the most lateral hemisphere. Reconstruction showed that the paraflocculus and flocculus were formed by a single longitudinal sheet, the axis of which was parallel to the aldolase C compartments, PC dendrites, and olivocerebellar climbing fiber distribution. The results indicate that molecular compartmentalization in the marmoset cerebellum reflected both the common fundamental organization of the mammalian cerebellum and species-dependent differentiation.},

Foraging proficiency in the same rats was then studied in a transfer-of-training test. Food pellets were hidden among never-before experienced objects and the rats were permitted to explore freely. Reinforced rats discovered and consumed more pellets than Exposed; and LEs discovered and consumed more than PVGs. Thus a bold genetic strain and reinforcement of variability independently contributed to successful foraging behavior. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex span multiple cortical layers. How the excitable properties of pyramidal neuron dendrites allow these neurons to both integrate activity and store associations between different layers is not well understood, but is thought to rely in part on dendritic backpropagation of action potentials. Here we demonstrate that the sign of synaptic plasticity in neocortical pyramidal neurons is regulated by the spread of the backpropagating action potential to the synapse. This creates a progressive gradient between LTP and LTD as the distance of the synaptic contacts from the soma increases. At distal synapses, cooperative synaptic input or dendritic depolarization can switch plasticity between LTD and LTP by boosting backpropagation of action potentials. This activity-dependent switch provides a mechanism for associative learning across different neocortical layers that process distinct types of information.},

The natural vocalizations of animals are syntactically simple, but several studies indicate that animals can detect and discriminate more complex structures in acoustic stimuli. However, how they discriminate such structures is often not clear. Using an artificial grammar learning paradigm, zebra finches were tested in a Go/No-go experiment for their ability to distinguish structurally different three-element sound sequences. In Experiment 1, zebra finches learned to discriminate ABA and BAB from ABB, AAB, BBA, and ABB sequences. Tests with probe sounds consisting of four elements suggested that the discrimination was based on attending to the presence or absence of repeated A- and B-elements. One bird generalized the discrimination to a new element type. In Experiment 2, we continued the training by adding four-element songs following a 'first and last identical versus different' rule that could not be solved by attending to repetitions. Only two out of five birds learned the overall discrimination. Testing with novel probes demonstrated that discrimination was not based on using the 'first and last identical' rule, but on attending to the presence or absence of the individual training stimuli. The two birds differed in the strategies used. Our results thus demonstrate only a limited degree of abstract rule learning but highlight the need for extensive and critical probe testing to examine the rules that animals (and humans) use to solve artificial grammar learning tasks. They also underline that rule learning strategies may differ between individuals.},

abstract = {Despite being commonly referenced throughout neuroscientific research on songbirds, reports of hemispheric specialization in the processing of song remain controversial. The notion of such asymmetries in songbirds is further complicated by evidence that both cerebral hemispheres in humans may be specialized for different aspects of speech perception. Some studies suggest that the auditory neural substrates in the left and right hemispheres of humans process temporal and spectral elements within speech sounds, respectively. To determine whether songbirds process their conspecific songs in such a complementary, bilateral manner, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on 15 isoflurane anesthetized adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) while presenting them with (1) non-manipulated, (2) spectrally-filtered (reduced spectral structure), and (3) temporally-filtered (reduced temporal structure) conspecific song. Our results revealed sensitivity of both primary (Field L) and secondary (caudomedial nidopallium, NCM) auditory regions to changes in spectral and temporal structure of song. On the one hand, temporally-filtered song elicited a bilateral decrease in neural responses compared to the other stimulus types. On the other hand, spectrally filtered song elicited significantly greater responses in left Field L and NCM than temporally filtered or non-manipulated song while concurrently reducing the response relative to non-manipulated song in the right auditory forebrain. The latter hemispheric difference in sensitivity to manipulations of spectral structure in song, suggests that there is an asymmetry in spectral and temporal domain processing in the zebra finch auditory forebrain bearing some resemblance to what has been observed in human auditory cortex.},

In recent years, it has become evident that there can be many forms of both synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity within this system and that each might have a different role in developing and maintaining motor learning across a wide range of tasks. There are several possible molecular and cellular mechanisms that could underlie adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and eyeblink conditioning. Although causal relationships between particular cellular processes and individual components of a learned behaviour have not been demonstrated unequivocally, an overall picture is emerging that the different types and sites of cellular plasticity relate importantly to the stage of learning and/or its temporal specifics.},

abstract = {The great majority of the world's music is metrical, i.e., has periodic structure at multiple time scales. Does the metrical structure of a non-isochronous rhythm improve synchronization with a beat compared to synchronization with an isochronous sequence at the beat period? Beat synchronization is usually associated with auditory stimuli, but are people able to extract a beat from rhythmic visual sequences with metrical structure? We addressed these questions by presenting listeners with rhythmic patterns which were either isochronous or non-isochronous in either the auditory or visual modality, and by asking them to tap to the beat, which was prescribed to occur at 800-ms intervals. For auditory patterns, we found that a strongly metrical structure did not improve overall accuracy of synchronization compared with isochronous patterns of the same beat period, though it did influence the higher-level patterning of taps. Synchronization was impaired in weakly metrical patterns in which some beats were silent. For the visual patterns, we found that participants were generally unable to synchronize to metrical non-isochronous rhythms, or to rapid isochronous rhythms. This suggests that beat perception and synchronization have a special affinity with the auditory system.},

abstract = {Adult zebra finch songs consist of stereotyped sequences of syllables. Although some behavioral and physiological data suggest that songs are structured hierarchically, there is also evidence that they are driven by nonhierarchical, clock-like bursting in the premotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name). In this study, we developed a semiautomated template-matching algorithm to identify repeated sequences of syllables and a modified dynamic time-warping algorithm to make fine-grained measurements of the temporal structure of song. We find that changes in song length are expressed across the song as a whole rather than resulting from an accumulation of independent variance during singing. Song length changes systematically over the course of a day and is related to the general level of bird activity as well as the presence of a female. The data also show patterns of variability that suggest distinct mechanisms underlying syllable and gap lengths: as tempo varies, syllables stretch and compress proportionally less than gaps, whereas syllable-syllable and gap-gap correlations are significantly stronger than syllable-gap correlations. There is also increased temporal variability at motif boundaries and especially strong positive correlations between the same syllables sung in different motifs. Finally, we find evidence that syllable onsets may have a special role in aligning syllables with global song structure. Generally, the timing data support a hierarchical view in which song is composed of smaller syllable-based units and provide a rich set of constraints for interpreting the results of physiological recordings.},

abstract = {Laboratory training and testing of auditory recognition skills in animals is important for understanding animal communication systems that depend on auditory cues. Songbirds are commonly studied because of their exceptional ability to learn complex vocalizations. In recent years, mounting interest in the perceptual abilities of songbirds has increased the demand for laboratory behavioural training and testing paradigms. Here, we describe and demonstrate the success of a method for auditory discrimination experiments, including all the necessary hardware, training procedures and freely available, versatile software. The system can run several behavioural training and testing paradigms, including operant (go-nogo, stimulus preference and two-alternative forced choice) and classical conditioning tasks. The software and some hardware components can be used with any laboratory animal that learns and responds to sensory cues. The peripheral hardware and training procedures are designed for use with songbirds and auditory stimuli. Using the go-nogo paradigm of the training system, we show that adult zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, learn to recognize and correctly classify individual female calls and male songs. We also show that learning the task generalizes to new stimulus classes; birds that learned the task with calls subsequently learned to recognize songs faster than did birds that learned the task and songs at the same time. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This possibility has been repeatedly ruled out for the past 30 years, with the prevailing theoretical accounts relying on a memory-based explanation instead.

abstract = {Natural experience can cause complex changes in gene expression in brain centers for cognition and perception, but the mechanisms that link perceptual experience and neurogenomic regulation are not understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have the potential to regulate large gene expression networks, and a previous study showed that a natural perceptual stimulus (hearing the sound of birdsong in zebra finches) triggers rapid changes in expression of several miRs in the auditory forebrain. Here we evaluate the functional potential of one of these, miR-2954, which has been found so far only in birds and is encoded on the Z sex chromosome. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we show that miR-2954 is present in subsets of cells in the sexually dimorphic brain regions involved in song production and perception, with notable enrichment in cell nuclei. We then probe its regulatory function by inhibiting its expression in a zebra finch cell line (G266) and measuring effects on endogenous gene expression using Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Approximately 1000 different mRNAs change in expression by 1.5-fold or more (adjusted p {\textless} 0.01), with increases in some but not all of the targets that had been predicted by Targetscan. The population of RNAs that increase after miR-2954 inhibition is notably enriched for ones involved in the MAP Kinase (MAPK) pathway, whereas the decreasing population is dominated by genes involved in ribosomes and mitochondrial function. Since song stimulation itself triggers a decrease in miR-2954 expression followed by a delayed decrease in genes encoding ribosomal and mitochondrial functions, we suggest that miR-2954 may mediate some of the neurogenomic effects of song habituation.},

Here we show that there are two largely distinct populations of neurons in the auditory cortex of awake primates: one with stimulus-synchronized discharges that, with a temporal code, explicitly represented slowly occurring sound sequences and the other with non-stimulus-synchronized discharges that, with a rate code, implicitly represented rapidly occurring events. Furthermore, neurons of both populations displayed selectivity in their discharge rates to temporal features within a short time-window. Our results suggest that the combination of temporal and rate codes in the auditory cortex provides a possible neural basis for the wide perceptual range of temporal information.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the question, why are striking special skills so much more common in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) than in other groups? Current cognitive accounts of ASC are briefly reviewed in relation to special skills. Difficulties in 'theory of mind' may contribute to originality in ASC, since individuals who do not automatically 'read other minds' may be better able to think outside prevailing fashions and popular theories. However, originality alone does not confer talent. Executive dysfunction has been suggested as the 'releasing' mechanism for special skills in ASC, but other groups with executive difficulties do not show raised incidence of talents. Detail-focused processing bias ('weak coherence', 'enhanced perceptual functioning') appears to be the most promising predisposing characteristic, or 'starting engine', for talent development. In support of this notion, we summarize data from a population-based twin study in which parents reported on their 8-year-olds' talents and their ASC-like traits. Across the whole sample, ASC-like traits, and specifically 'restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests' related to detail focus, were more pronounced in children reported to have talents outstripping older children. We suggest that detail-focused cognitive style predisposes to talent in savant domains in, and beyond, autism spectrum disorders.},

abstract = {Endocannabinoid mediated spike timing-dependent depression (t-LTD) is crucially involved in the development of the sensory neocortex. t-LTD at excitatory synapses in the developing rat barrel cortex requires cannabinoid CB(1) receptor (CB(1)R) activation, as well as activation of NMDA receptors located on the presynaptic terminal, but the exact signaling cascade leading to t-LTD remains unclear. We found that astrocytes are critically involved in t-LTD. Astrocytes gradually increased their Ca(2+) signaling specifically during the induction of t-LTD in a CB(1)R-dependent manner. In this way, astrocytes might act as a memory buffer for previous coincident neuronal activity. Following activation, astrocytes released glutamate, which activated presynaptic NMDA receptors to induce t-LTD. Astrocyte stimulation coincident with afferent activity resulted in long-term depression, indicating that astrocyte activation is sufficient for the induction of synaptic depression. Taken together, our findings describe the retrograde signaling cascade underlying neocortical t-LTD. The critical involvement of astrocytes in this process highlights their importance for experience-dependent sensory remodeling.},

abstract = {Mate choice is among the most consequential decisions a sexually reproducing organism can make. In many songbird species, females make mate-choice decisions based, in part, on variation between males in songs that reflect their quality. Importantly, females may adjust their choice relative to the prevalence of high quality songs. In European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), females prefer males that primarily sing long songs over those that primarily sing short songs, and sensitivity of the auditory telencephalon to song length depends on the prevalence of long songs in the environment. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for noradrenergic innervation of the auditory telencephalon in mediating this neuro- and behavioral plasticity. To simulate variation in quality of the song environment, we exposed adult female starlings to 1 week of either long or short songs and then quantified several monoamines and their metabolites in the caudomedial mesopallium and caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) using high performance liquid chromatography. We also used immunocytochemistry to assess these areas for immunoreactive dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH-ir), the enzyme that synthesizes norepinephrine. We found that long songs elevated levels of the principal norepinephrine metabolite, the principal dopamine metabolite, and the probability of DBH-ir in the NCM compared to short songs. Song environment did not appear to influence norepinephrine or dopamine levels. Thus, the quality of the song environment regulates the local secretion of catecholamines, particularly norepinephrine, in the female auditory telencephalon. This may form a basis for plasticity in forebrain sensitivity and mate-choice behavior based on the prevalence of high-quality males.},

abstract = {The experience of musical rhythm is a remarkable psychophysical phenomenon, in part because the perception of periodicities, namely pulse and meter, arise from stimuli that are not periodic. One possible function of such a transformation is to enable synchronization between individuals through perception of a common abstract temporal structure (e.g., during music performance). Thus, understanding the brain processes that underlie rhythm perception is fundamental to explaining musical behavior. Here, we propose that neural resonance provides an excellent account of many aspects of human rhythm perception. Our framework is consistent with recent brain-imaging studies showing neural correlates of rhythm perception in high-frequency oscillatory activity, and leads to the hypothesis that perception of pulse and meter result from rhythmic bursts of high-frequency neural activity in response to musical rhythms. High-frequency bursts of activity may enable communication between neural areas, such as auditory and motor cortices, during rhythm perception and production.},

abstract = {It is well established that auditory forebrain regions of oscine birds are essential for the encoding of species-typical songs and are, therefore, vital for recognition of song during sociosexual interactions. Regions such as the caudal medial nidopallium (NCM) and the caudal medial mesopallium (CMM) are involved in perceptual processing of song and the formation of auditory memories. There is an additional telencephalic nucleus, however, that has also been implicated in species recognition. This nucleus is HVC, a prominent nucleus that sits at the apex of the song system, and is well known for its critical role in song learning and song production in male songbirds. Here, we explore the functional relationship between auditory forebrain regions (i.e., NCM and CMM) and HVC in female canaries (Serinus canaria). We lesion HVC and examine immediate early gene responses to conspecific song presentation within CMM and NCM to explore whether HVC can modulate auditory responses within these forebrain regions. Our results reveal robust deficits in ZENK-ir in CMM and NCM of HVC-lesioned females when compared with control- and sham-lesioned females, indicating that functional connections exists between HVC and NCM/CMM. Although these connected regions have been implicated in song learning and production in males, they likely serve distinct functions in female songbirds that face the task of song recognition rather than song production. Identifying functional connections between HVC and auditory regions involved in song perception is an essential step toward developing a comprehensive understanding of the neural basis of song recognition.},

abstract = {Mammalian associative learning is organized into separate anatomically defined functional systems. We illustrate the organization of two of these systems, Pavlovian fear conditioning and Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning, by describing studies using mutant mice, brain stimulation and recording, brain lesions and direct pharmacological manipulations of specific brain regions. The amygdala serves as the neuroanatomical hub of the former, whereas the cerebellum is the hub of the latter. Pathways that carry information about signals for biologically important events arrive at these hubs by circuitry that depends on stimulus modality and complexity. Within the amygdala and cerebellum, neural plasticity occurs because of convergence of these stimuli and the biologically important information they predict. This neural plasticity is the physical basis of associative memory formation, and although the intracellular mechanisms of plasticity within these structures share some similarities, they differ significantly. The last Annual Review of Psychology article to specifically tackle the question of mammalian associative learning ( Lavond et al. 1993 ) persuasively argued that identifiable "essential" circuits encode memories formed during associative learning. The next dozen years saw breathtaking progress not only in detailing those essential circuits but also in identifying the essential processes occurring at the synapses (e.g., Bi {\&} Poo 2001, Martinez {\&} Derrick 1996 ) and within the neurons (e.g., Malinow {\&} Malenka 2002, Murthy {\&} De Camilli 2003 ) that make up those circuits. In this chapter, we describe the orientation that the neuroscience of learning has taken and review some of the progress made within that orientation.},

In this experiment, four pigeons were tested with three types of auditory rhythmic discriminations to investigate their processing of this aspect of sound and music. Two experiments examined a meter discrimination in which successively presented idiophonic sounds were repeated in meters of different lengths in a go/no-go discrimination task. With difficulty, the birds eventually learned to discriminate between 8/4 and 3/4 meters constructed from cymbal and tom drum sounds at 180 beats per minute. This discrimination subsequently transferred to faster tempos, but not to different drum sounds or their combination. Experiment 3 tested rhythmic and arrhythmic patterns of sounds. After 40 sessions of training, these same pigeons showed no discrimination. Experiment 4 tested repetitions of a piano sound at fast and slow tempos. This discrimination was readily learned and showed transfer to novel tempos. The pattern of results suggests that pigeons can time periodic auditory events, but their capacity to understand generalized rhythmic groupings appears limited.},

The present study sought to determine whether increasing metricality, meaning the amount of information supporting an intended meter, would elicit a corresponding increase in the precision of the temporal encoding of rhythmic sequences. Metricality was varied i) by using the Povel and Essens (1985) model of temporal accent induction to create a strong or weak sense of meter and ii) by including metrically plausible (compact) or implausible (open) endings. Precision of temporal encoding as a function of degree of metricality was assessed in an adaptively controlled change detection task. The change to be detected was a perturbation of relative interval timing that affected sequences as a whole rather than at specific points only. Change detection thresholds were significantly lower for sequences featuring a strong compared to a weak meter, and a compact compared to an open ending. Subjective ratings of rhythmicality of sequences also yielded main effects of strength of meter and ending. The data support an increase in the precision of temporal pattern encoding for sequences with a higher-order metrical time framework.},

Various PD rodent models have been developed to investigate the genetic and brain circuit-related causes of PD and have contributed to the basic and clinical research and to therapeutic strategies for this disease. Most studies using PD rodent models have focused on the motor output deficits, rather than cognitive disabilities due to the lack of appropriate testing tools that do not require significant motor abilities. In this study, we assessed the cognitive disabilities of PD model mice using a touch screen test that required only little motor ability. We found that the PD model mice, which had motor deficits caused by unilateral striatal dopaminergic degeneration, successfully underwent operant conditioning with a touch screen test. Additionally, we found that the PD model mice demonstrated impaired location discrimination, but intact attention and reversal learning in the cognitive tests. Therefore, the touch screen test is useful for assessing hidden cognitive disabilities in disease model animals with decreased motor function.},

abstract = {Neuroanatomical and functional asymmetries are universal features of the vertebrate CNS, but how asymmetry is generated is unknown. Here we show that zebrafish fgf8 mutants do not elaborate forebrain asymmetries, demonstrated by the failure of the parapineal nucleus to migrate from its initial midline position to the left side of the brain. Local provision of Fgf8 restores the asymmetric migration of parapineal cells, usually to the left, irrespective of the location of the Fgf8 source. This laterality bias is due to left-sided Nodal signaling and when the bias in Nodal signaling is removed, parapineal cells migrate toward the source of Fgf8 protein. This study presents a mechanism for breaking neuroanatomical symmetry through Fgf8-dependent regulation of bistable left- or right-sided migration of the parapineal. The combined action of Fgf and Nodal signals ensures the establishment of neuroanatomical asymmetries with consistent laterality.},

abstract = {The neural representations associated with learned auditory behaviours, such as recognizing individuals based on their vocalizations, are not well described. Higher vertebrates learn to recognize complex conspecific vocalizations that comprise sequences of easily identified, naturally occurring auditory objects, which should facilitate the analysis of higher auditory pathways. Here we describe the first example of neurons selective for learned conspecific vocalizations in adult animals--in starlings that have been trained operantly to recognize conspecific songs. The neuronal population is found in a non-primary forebrain auditory region, exhibits increased responses to the set of learned songs compared with novel songs, and shows differential responses to categories of learned songs based on recognition training contingencies. Within the population, many cells respond highly selectively to a subset of specific motifs (acoustic objects) present only in the learned songs. Such neuronal selectivity may contribute to song-recognition behaviour, which in starlings is sensitive to motif identity. In this system, both top-down and bottom-up processes may modify the tuning properties of neurons during recognition learning, giving rise to plastic representations of behaviourally meaningful auditory objects.},

Some antagonists such as BOL (d-bromolysergic acid diethylamide), LY53,857, and ketanserin acted as neutral antagonists in that they had no effect on learning, whereas others (MDL11,939, ritanserin, and mianserin) acted as inverse agonists in that they retarded learning through an action at the 5-HT2A receptor. These results were placed in the context of what is known concerning the anatomical distribution and electrophysiological effects of 5-HT2A receptor activation in frontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as the role of cortical 5-HT2A receptors in schizophrenia. It was concluded that the 5-HT2A receptor demonstrates constitutive activity, and that variations in this activity can produce profound alterations in cognitive states.},

This ability, fundamental both for music production and for coordinated dance, has been repeatedly highlighted as uniquely human [4-11]. However, it has recently been hypothesized that entrainment evolved as a by-product of vocal mimicry, generating the strong prediction that only vocal mimicking animals may be able to entrain [12, 13]. Here we provide comparative data demonstrating the existence of two proficient vocal mimicking nonhuman animals (parrots) that entrain to music, spontaneously producing synchronized movements resembling human dance. We also provide an extensive comparative data set from a global video database systematically analyzed for evidence of entrainment in hundreds of species both capable and incapable of vocal mimicry. Despite the higher representation of vocal nonmimics in the database and comparable exposure of mimics and nonmimics to humans and music, only vocal mimics showed evidence of entrainment. We conclude that entrainment is not unique to humans and that the distribution of entrainment across species supports the hypothesis that entrainment evolved as a by-product of selection for vocal mimicry.},

abstract = {There is a convergence between cognitive models of imitation, constructs derived from social psychology studies on mimicry and empathy, and recent empirical findings from the neurosciences. The ideomotor framework of human actions assumes a common representational format for action and perception that facilitates imitation. Furthermore, the associative sequence learning model of imitation proposes that experience-based Hebbian learning forms links between sensory processing of the actions of others and motor plans. Social psychology studies have demonstrated that imitation and mimicry are pervasive, automatic, and facilitate empathy. Neuroscience investigations have demonstrated physiological mechanisms of mirroring at single-cell and neural-system levels that support the cognitive and social psychology constructs. Why were these neural mechanisms selected, and what is their adaptive advantage? Neural mirroring solves the "problem of other minds" (how we can access and understand the minds of others) and makes intersubjectivity possible, thus facilitating social behavior.},

abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission provides an experimental model for studying mechanisms of memory. The classical form of LTP relies on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), and it has been shown that astroglia can regulate their activation through Ca(2+)-dependent release of the NMDAR co-agonist D-serine. Release of D-serine from glia enables LTP in cultures and explains a correlation between glial coverage of synapses and LTP in the supraoptic nucleus. However, increases in Ca(2+) concentration in astroglia can also release other signalling molecules, most prominently glutamate, ATP and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, whereas neurons themselves can synthesize and supply D-serine. Furthermore, loading an astrocyte with exogenous Ca(2+) buffers does not suppress LTP in hippocampal area CA1 (refs 14-16), and the physiological relevance of experiments in cultures or strong exogenous stimuli applied to astrocytes has been questioned. The involvement of glia in LTP induction therefore remains controversial. Here we show that clamping internal Ca(2+) in individual CA1 astrocytes blocks LTP induction at nearby excitatory synapses by decreasing the occupancy of the NMDAR co-agonist sites. This LTP blockade can be reversed by exogenous D-serine or glycine, whereas depletion of D-serine or disruption of exocytosis in an individual astrocyte blocks local LTP. We therefore demonstrate that Ca(2+)-dependent release of D-serine from an astrocyte controls NMDAR-dependent plasticity in many thousands of excitatory synapses nearby.},

abstract = {Despite the apparent uniformity in cellular composition of the adult mammalian cerebellar cortex, it is actually highly compartmentalized into transverse zones and within each zone further subdivided into a reproducible array of parasagittal stripes. This basic cerebellar architecture is highly conserved in birds and mammals. However, different species have very different cerebellar morphologies, and it is unclear if cerebellar architecture reflects taxonomic relations or ecological niches. To explore this, we have examined the cerebellum of the naked mole-rat Heterocephalus glaber, a burrowing rodent with adaptations to a subterranean life that include only a rudimentary visual system. The cerebellum of H. glaber resembles that of other rodents with the remarkable exception that cerebellar regions that are prominent in the handling of visual information (the central zone, nodular zone, and dorsal paraflocculus) are greatly reduced or absent. In addition, there is a notable increase in size in the posterior zone, consistent with an expanded role for the trigeminal somatosensory system. These data suggest that cerebellar architecture may be substantially modified to serve a particular ecological niche.},

abstract = {The ability to choose rapidly among multiple targets embedded in a complex perceptual environment is key to survival. Targets may differ in their reward value as well as in their low-level perceptual properties (e.g., visual saliency). Previous studies investigated separately the impact of either value or saliency on choice; thus, it is not known how the brain combines these two variables during decision making. We addressed this question with three experiments in which human subjects attempted to maximize their monetary earnings by rapidly choosing items from a brief display. Each display contained several worthless items (distractors) as well as two targets, whose value and saliency were varied systematically. We compared the behavioral data with the predictions of three computational models assuming that (i) subjects seek the most valuable item in the display, (ii) subjects seek the most easily detectable item, and (iii) subjects behave as an ideal Bayesian observer who combines both factors to maximize the expected reward within each trial. Regardless of the type of motor response used to express the choices, we find that decisions are influenced by both value and feature-contrast in a way that is consistent with the ideal Bayesian observer, even when the targets' feature-contrast is varied unpredictably between trials. This suggests that individuals are able to harvest rewards optimally and dynamically under time pressure while seeking multiple targets embedded in perceptual clutter.},

abstract = {That all events are equally associable and obey common laws is a central assumption of general process learning theory. A continuum of preparedness is denned which holds that organisms are prepared to associate certain events, unprepared for some, and contraprepared for others. A review of data from the traditional learning paradigms shows that the assumption of equivalent associability is false: in classical conditioning, rats are prepared to associate tastes with illness even over very long delays of reinforcement, but are contraprepared to associate tastes with footshock. In instrumental training, pigeons acquire key pecking in the absence of a contingency between pecking and grain (prepared), while cats, on the other hand, have trouble learning to lick themselves to escape, and dogs do not yawn for food (contra- prepared). In discrimination, dogs are contraprepared to learn that different locations of discriminative stimuli control go-no go responding, and to learn that different qualities control directional responding. sponses from the natural defensive repertoire are prepared for avoiding shock, while those from the appetitive repertoire are contraprepared. Language acquisition and the functional autonomy of motives are also viewed using the preparedness continuum. Finally, it is speculated that the laws of learning themselves may vary with the preparedness of the organism for the associa- tion and that different physiological and cognitive mechanisms may covary with the dimension.

abstract = {Multisensory neurons are now known to be widespread in low-level regions of the cortex usually thought of as being responsible for modality-specific processing. The auditory cortex provides a particularly striking example of this, exhibiting responses to both visual and somatosensory stimulation. Single-neuron recording studies in ferrets have shown that each of auditory fields that have been characterized using physiological and anatomical criteria also receives visual inputs, with the incidence of visually-sensitive neurons ranging from 15{\%} to 20{\%} in the primary areas to around 50{\%} or more in higher-level areas. Although some neurons exhibit spiking responses to visual stimulation, these inputs often have subthreshold influences that modulate the responses of the cortical neurons to sound. Insights into the possible role played by the visual inputs can be obtained by examining their sources of origin and the way in which they alter the processing capabilities of neurons in the auditory cortex. These studies suggest that one of the functions of the visual input to auditory cortex is to sharpen the relatively imprecise spatial coding typically found there. Because the extent to which this happens varies between cortical fields, the investigation of multisensory interactions can also help in understanding their relative contributions to auditory perception.},

abstract = {Auditory neurons are often described in terms of their spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs). These map the relationship between features of the sound spectrogram and firing rates of neurons. Recently, we showed that neurons in the primary fields of the ferret auditory cortex are also subject to gain control: when sounds undergo smaller fluctuations in their level over time, the neurons become more sensitive to small-level changes (Rabinowitz et al., 2011). Just as STRFs measure the spectrotemporal features of a sound that lead to changes in the firing rates of neurons, in this study, we sought to estimate the spectrotemporal regions in which sound statistics lead to changes in the gain of neurons. We designed a set of stimuli with complex contrast profiles to characterize these regions. This allowed us to estimate the STRFs of cortical neurons alongside a set of spectrotemporal contrast kernels. We find that these two sets of integration windows match up: the extent to which a stimulus feature causes the firing rate of a neuron to change is strongly correlated with the extent to which the contrast of that feature modulates the gain of the neuron. Adding contrast kernels to STRF models also yields considerable improvements in the ability to capture and predict how auditory cortical neurons respond to statistically complex sounds.},

This was shown in a synchronization-continuation paradigm (Experiment 1) and in a reproduction task (Experiment 2a). Participants also judged the tempo of a subdivided sequence as being slower than that of a preceding simple beat sequence (Experiment 2b). Experiment 2 also included nonmusician participants, with similar results. Tempo measurements of famous pianists' recordings of two variation movements from Beethoven sonatas revealed a strong tendency to play the first variation (subdivided beats) faster than the theme (mostly simple beats). A similar tendency was found in musicians' laboratory performances of a simple theme and variations, despite instruc-tions to keep the tempo constant (Experiment 3a). When playing melodic sequences in which only one of three beats per measure was subdivided, musicians tended to play these beats faster and to perceive them as longer than adjacent beats, and they played the whole sequence faster than a sequence without any subdivisions (Experiments 3b and 3c). The results amply demonstrate a filled duration illusion in rhythm perception and music performance: Intervals containing events seem longer than empty intervals and thus must be shortened to be perceived as equal in duration.},

The principal auditory forebrain area in songbirds consists of the tonotopically organized field L complex, which, by its location in the auditory processing stream, can be compared with the auditory cortex of mammals. We also recorded from a secondary auditory area, cHV. Field L and cHV are auditory processing stages that are presynaptic to the specialized song system nuclei where auditory neurons show an extremely selective response for the bird's own song, but weak response to almost any other sounds, including conspecific songs. In our study, we found that neurons in field L and cHV had stronger responses to conspecific song than to synthetic sounds that were designed to match the lower order acoustical properties of song, such as their overall power spectra and AM spectra. Such preferential responses to natural sounds cannot be explained by linear frequency tuning or simple nonlinear intensity tuning and requires linear or nonlinear spectro-temporal neuronal transfer functions tuned to the acoustical properties of song. The selectivity for conspecific songs in field L and cHV might reflect an intermediate auditory processing stage for vocalizations that then contributes to the generation of the very specific selectivity for the bird's own song seen in the postsynaptic song system.},

abstract = {Cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit a unique type of synaptic plasticity, namely, long-term depression (LTD). When two inputs to a Purkinje cell, one from a climbing fiber and the other from a set of granule cell axons, are repeatedly associated, the input efficacy of the granule cell axons in exciting the Purkinje cell is persistently depressed. Section I of this review briefly describes the history of research around LTD, and section II specifies physiological characteristics of LTD. Sections III and IV then review the massive data accumulated during the past two decades, which have revealed complex networks of signal transduction underlying LTD. Section III deals with a variety of first messengers, receptors, ion channels, transporters, G proteins, and phospholipases. Section IV covers second messengers, protein kinases, phosphatases and other elements, eventually leading to inactivation of DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolone-propionate-selective glutamate receptors that mediate granule cell-to-Purkinje cell transmission. Section V defines roles of LTD in the light of the microcomplex concept of the cerebellum as functionally eliminating those synaptic connections associated with errors during repeated exercises, while preserving other connections leading to the successful execution of movements. Section VI examines the validity of this microcomplex concept based on the data collected from recent numerous studies of various forms of motor learning in ocular reflexes, eye-blink conditioning, posture, locomotion, and hand/arm movements. Section VII emphasizes the importance of integrating studies on LTD and learning and raises future possibilities of extending cerebellar research to reveal memory mechanisms of implicit learning in general.},

abstract = {We study unsupervised Hebbian learning in a recurrent network in which synapses have a finite number of stable states. Stimuli received by the network are drawn at random at each presentation from a set of classes. Each class is defined as a cluster in stimulus space, centred on the class prototype. The presentation protocol is chosen to mimic the protocols of visual memory experiments in which a set of stimuli is presented repeatedly in a random way. The statistics of the input stream may be stationary, or changing. Each stimulus induces, in a stochastic way, transitions between stable synaptic states. Learning dynamics is studied analytically in the slow learning limit, in which a given stimulus has to be presented many times before it is memorized, i.e. before synaptic modifications enable a pattern of activity correlated with the stimulus to become an attractor of the recurrent network. We show that in this limit the synaptic matrix becomes more correlated with the class prototypes than with any of the instances of the class. We also show that the number of classes that can be learned increases sharply when the coding level decreases, and determine the speeds of learning and forgetting of classes in the case of changes in the statistics of the input stream.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the current study we compared the effects of temporal orienting of attention based on predictions carried by the intrinsic temporal structure of events (rhythm) and by instructive symbolic cues; and tested the degree of cognitive, strategic control that could be exerted over each type of temporal expectation. The experiments tested whether the distinction between exogenous and endogenous orienting made in spatial attention may extend to the temporal domain. TASK DESIGN AND MAIN RESULTS: In this task, a ball moved across the screen in discrete steps and disappeared temporarily under an occluding band. Participants were required to make a perceptual discrimination on the target upon its reappearance. The regularity of the speed (rhythmic cue) or colour (symbolic cue) of the moving stimulus could predict the exact time at which a target would reappear after a brief occlusion (valid trials) or provide no temporal information (neutral trials). The predictive nature of rhythmic and symbolic cues was manipulated factorially in a symmetrical and orthogonal fashion. To test for the effects of strategic control over temporal orienting based on rhythmic or symbolic cues, participants were instructed either to "attend-to-speed" (rhythm) or "attend-to-colour". Our results indicated that both rhythmic and symbolic (colour) cues speeded reaction times in an independent fashion. However, whilst the rhythmic cueing effects were impervious to instruction, the effects of symbolic cues were contingent on the instruction to attend to colour. FINAL CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results provide evidence for the existence of qualitatively separable types of temporal orienting of attention, akin to exogenous and endogenous mechanisms.},

@article{Morey2008,
abstract = {How neurons make specific synaptic connections is a central question in neurobiology. The targeting of the Drosophila R7 and R8 photoreceptor axons to different synaptic layers in the brain provides a model with which to explore the genetic programs regulating target specificity. In principle this can be accomplished by cell-type-specific molecules mediating the recognition between synaptic partners. Alternatively, specificity could also be achieved through cell-type-specific repression of particular targeting molecules. Here we show that a key step in the targeting of the R7 neuron is the active repression of the R8 targeting program. Repression is dependent on NF-YC, a subunit of the NF-Y (nuclear factor Y) transcription factor. In the absence of NF-YC, R7 axons terminate in the same layer as R8 axons. Genetic experiments indicate that this is due solely to the derepression of the R8-specific transcription factor Senseless (Sens) late in R7 differentiation. Sens is sufficient to control R8 targeting specificity and we demonstrate that Sens directly binds to an evolutionarily conserved DNA sequence upstream of the start of transcription of an R8-specific cell-surface protein, Capricious (Caps) that regulates R8 target specificity. We show that R7 targeting requires the R7-specific transcription factor Prospero (Pros) in parallel to repression of the R8 targeting pathway by NF-YC. Previous studies demonstrated that Sens and Pros directly regulate the expression of specific rhodopsins in R8 and R7. We propose that the use of the same transcription factors to promote the cell-type-specific expression of sensory receptors and cell-surface proteins regulating synaptic target specificity provides a simple and general mechanism for ensuring that transmission of sensory information is processed by the appropriate specialized neural circuits.},

@article{Shouval2010,
abstract = {Spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a phenomenon in which the precise timing of spikes affects the sign and magnitude of changes in synaptic strength. STDP is often interpreted as the comprehensive learning rule for a synapse - the "first law" of synaptic plasticity. This interpretation is made explicit in theoretical models in which the total plasticity produced by complex spike patterns results from a superposition of the effects of all spike pairs. Although such models are appealing for their simplicity, they can fail dramatically. For example, the measured single-spike learning rule between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons does not predict the existence of long-term potentiation one of the best-known forms of synaptic plasticity. Layers of complexity have been added to the basic STDP model to repair predictive failures, but they have been outstripped by experimental data. We propose an alternate first law: neural activity triggers changes in key biochemical intermediates, which act as a more direct trigger of plasticity mechanisms. One particularly successful model uses intracellular calcium as the intermediate and can account for many observed properties of bidirectional plasticity. In this formulation, STDP is not itself the basis for explaining other forms of plasticity, but is instead a consequence of changes in the biochemical intermediate, calcium. Eventually a mechanism-based framework for learning rules should include other messengers, discrete change at individual synapses, spread of plasticity among neighboring synapses, and priming of hidden processes that change a synapse's susceptibility to future change. Mechanism-based models provide a rich framework for the computational representation of synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {The zebra finch learns his song by memorizing a tutor's vocalization and then using auditory feedback to match his current vocalization to this memory, or template. The neural song system of adult and young birds responds to auditory stimuli, and exhibits selective tuning to the bird's own song (BOS). We have directly examined the development of neural tuning in the song motor system. We measured song system responses to vocalizations produced at various ages during sleep. We now report that the auditory response of the song motor system and motor output are linked early in song development. During sleep, playback of the current BOS induced a response in the song nucleus HVC during the song practice period, even when the song consisted of little more than repeated begging calls. Halfway through the sensorimotor period when the song was not yet in its final form, the response to BOS already exceeded that to all other auditory stimuli tested. Moreover, responses to previous, plastic versions of BOS decayed over time. This indicates that selective tuning to BOS mirrors the vocalization that the bird is currently producing.},

Three paired-associate experiments investigated the effects of the length of the retention interval, the kind of processing during incidental learning, and the number of study versus test trials during intentional learning. The findings, together with a review of selected studies in the literature, support three conclusions: (1) Latency of correct recall is not necessarily more sensitive than accuracy, (2) accuracy and latency of correct recall measure different aspects of memory, and (3) latency of correct recall and latency of incorrect recall measure different aspects of memory. The available data disconfirm the idea that any unidimensional construct (such as strength or the amount of information in memory) underlies memory performance. An explanation is offered that emphasizes the distinction between encoding and retrieval processes. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The classically conditioned eyeblink response in the rabbit is one of the best-characterized behavioral models of associative learning. It is cerebellum dependent, with many studies indicating that the hemispheral part of Larsell's cerebellar cortical lobule VI (HVI) is critical for the acquisition and performance of learned responses. However, there remain uncertainties about the distribution of the critical regions within and around HVI. In this learning, the unconditional stimulus is thought to be carried by periocular-activated climbing fibers. Here, we have used a microelectrode array to perform systematic, high-resolution, electrophysiological mapping of lobule HVI and surrounding folia in rabbits, to identify regions with periocular-evoked climbing fiber activity. Climbing fiber local field potentials and single-unit action potentials were recorded, and electrode locations were reconstructed from histological examination of brain sections. Much of the sampled cerebellar cortex, including large parts of lobule HVI, was unresponsive to periocular input. However, short-latency ipsilateral periocular-evoked climbing fiber responses were reliably found within a region in the ventral part of the medial wall of lobule HVI, extending to the base of the primary fissure. Small infusions of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX into this electrophysiologically defined region in awake rabbits diminished or abolished conditioned responses. The known parasagittal zonation of the cerebellum, supported by zebrin immunohistochemistry, indicates that these areas have connections consistent with an essential role in eyeblink conditioning. These small eyeblink-related areas provide cerebellar cortical targets for analysis of eyeblink conditioning at a neuronal level but need to be localized with electrophysiological identification in individual animals.},

abstract = {The nature of hemispheric specialization of brain activity during rhythm processing remains poorly understood. The locus for rhythmic processing has been difficult to identify and there have been several contradictory findings. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study passive rhythm perception to investigate the hypotheses that rhythm processing results in left hemispheric lateralization of brain activity and is affected by musical training. Twelve musicians and 12 nonmusicians listened to regular and random rhythmic patterns. Conjunction analysis revealed a shared network of neural structures (bilateral superior temporal areas, left inferior parietal lobule, and right frontal operculum) responsible for rhythm perception independent of musical background. In contrast, random-effects analysis showed greater left lateralization of brain activity in musicians compared to nonmusicians during regular rhythm perception, particularly within the perisylvian cortices (left frontal operculum, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule).

abstract = {Human speech and birdsong have numerous parallels. Both humans and songbirds learn their complex vocalizations early in life, exhibiting a strong dependence on hearing the adults they will imitate, as well as themselves as they practice, and a waning of this dependence as they mature. Innate predispositions for perceiving and learning the correct sounds exist in both groups, although more evidence of innate descriptions of species-specific signals exists in songbirds, where numerous species of vocal learners have been compared. Humans also share with songbirds an early phase of learning that is primarily perceptual, which then serves to guide later vocal production. Both humans and songbirds have evolved a complex hierarchy of specialized forebrain areas in which motor and auditory centers interact closely, and which control the lower vocal motor areas also found in nonlearners. In both these vocal learners, however, how auditory feedback of self is processed in these brain areas is surprisingly unclear. Finally, humans and songbirds have similar critical periods for vocal learning, with a much greater ability to learn early in life. In both groups, the capacity for late vocal learning may be decreased by the act of learning itself, as well as by biological factors such as the hormones of puberty. Although some features of birdsong and speech are clearly not analogous, such as the capacity of language for meaning, abstraction, and flexible associations, there are striking similarities in how sensory experience is internalized and used to shape vocal outputs, and how learning is enhanced during a critical period of development. Similar neural mechanisms may therefore be involved.},

abstract = {Research in crustaceans offers a valuable perspective for studying the neural implementation of conserved behavioral phenomena, including motivation, escape, aggression, and drug-sensitive reward. The present work adds to this literature by demonstrating that crayfish successfully learn to respond to spatially contingent cues. An integrated video-tracking system automatically delivered a mild electric shock when a test animal entered or remained on a substrate paired with punishment. Following a few instances of shock delivery, crayfish quickly learned to avoid these areas. Comparable changes in substrate preference were not exhibited by yoked controls, but locomotion differed significantly from both pre-conditioning levels and from those of their masters receiving shock in a contingent fashion. The results of this work provide valuable insights into the principles governing avoidance learning in an invertebrate system and provide a behavioral template for exploring the neural changes during associative learning. Serving as a case study, this project introduces a new computer framework for the automated control of learning paradigms. Based on routines contained within the JavaGrinders library (free download at iEthology.com), it integrates real-time video tracking with robotic interfaces, and provides a suitable framework for implementing automated learning paradigms.

Furthermore, the brain regions involved in birdsong learning, perception, and production have been identified and characterized in detail. In particular, the caudal medial nidopallium (the avian analog of the mammalian auditory-association cortex) has been found to contain the neural substrate of auditory memory, paving the way for analyses of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Recently, the zebra finch genome was sequenced, and annotated cDNA databases representing over 15,000 unique brain-expressed genes are available, enabling high-throughput gene expression analyses. Here we review the involvement of immediate early genes (e.g. zenk and arc), their downstream targets (e.g. synapsins), and their regulatory signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK/ERK) in songbird memory. We propose that in-depth investigations of zenk- and ERK-dependent cascades will help to further unravel the molecular basis of auditory memory.},

abstract = {Most striatal and cortical interneurons arise from the basal telencephalon, later segregating to their respective targets. Here, we show that migrating cortical interneurons avoid entering the striatum because of a chemorepulsive signal composed at least in part of semaphorin 3A and semaphorin 3F. Migrating interneurons expressing neuropilins, receptors for semaphorins, are directed to the cortex; those lacking them go to the striatum. Loss of neuropilin function increases the number of interneurons that migrate into the striatum. These observations reveal a mechanism by which neuropilins mediate sorting of distinct neuronal populations into different brain structures, and provide evidence that, in addition to guiding axons, these receptors also control neuronal migration in the central nervous system.},

abstract = {Electrical synapses between interneurons contribute to synchronized firing and network oscillations in the brain. However, little is known about how such networks respond to excitatory synaptic input. To investigate this, we studied electrically coupled Golgi cells (GoC) in the cerebellar input layer. We show with immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology that Connexin-36 is necessary for functional gap junctions (GJs) between GoC dendrites. In the absence of coincident synaptic input, GoCs synchronize their firing. In contrast, sparse, coincident mossy fiber input triggered a mixture of excitation and inhibition of GoC firing and spike desynchronization. Inhibition is caused by propagation of the spike afterhyperpolarization through GJs. This triggers network desynchronization because heterogeneous coupling to surrounding cells causes spike-phase dispersion. Detailed network models predict that desynchronization is robust, local, and dependent on synaptic input properties. Our results show that GJ coupling can be inhibitory and either promote network synchronization or trigger rapid network desynchronization depending on the synaptic input.},

@article{Ruiz2011,
abstract = {Skilled performance requires the ability to monitor ongoing behavior, detect errors in advance and modify the performance accordingly. The acquisition of fast predictive mechanisms might be possible due to the extensive training characterizing expertise performance. Recent EEG studies on piano performance reported a negative event-related potential (ERP) triggered in the ACC 70 ms before performance errors (pitch errors due to incorrect keypress). This ERP component, termed pre-error related negativity (pre-ERN), was assumed to reflect processes of error detection in advance. However, some questions remained to be addressed: (i) Does the electrophysiological marker prior to errors reflect an error signal itself or is it related instead to the implementation of control mechanisms? (ii) Does the posterior frontomedial cortex (pFMC, including ACC) interact with other brain regions to implement control adjustments following motor prediction of an upcoming error? (iii) Can we gain insight into the electrophysiological correlates of error prediction and control by assessing the local neuronal synchronization and phase interaction among neuronal populations? (iv) Finally, are error detection and control mechanisms defective in pianists with musician's dystonia (MD), a focal task-specific dystonia resulting from dysfunction of the basal ganglia-thalamic-frontal circuits? Consequently, we investigated the EEG oscillatory and phase synchronization correlates of error detection and control during piano performances in healthy pianists and in a group of pianists with MD. In healthy pianists, the main outcomes were increased pre-error theta and beta band oscillations over the pFMC and 13-15 Hz phase synchronization, between the pFMC and the right lateral prefrontal cortex, which predicted corrective mechanisms. In MD patients, the pattern of phase synchronization appeared in a different frequency band (6-8 Hz) and correlated with the severity of the disorder. The present findings shed new light on the neural mechanisms, which might implement motor prediction by means of forward control processes, as they function in healthy pianists and in their altered form in patients with MD.},

abstract = {Learned vocalization, the substrate for human language, is a rare trait. It is found in three distantly related groups of birds-parrots, hummingbirds, and songbirds. These three groups contain cerebral vocal nuclei for learned vocalization not found in their more closely related vocal nonlearning relatives. Here, we cloned 21 receptor subunits/subtypes of all four glutamate receptor families (AMPA, kainate, NMDA, and metabotropic) and examined their expression in vocal nuclei of songbirds. We also examined expression of a subset of these receptors in vocal nuclei of hummingbirds and parrots, as well as in the brains of dove species as examples of close vocal nonlearning relatives. Among the 21 subunits/subtypes, 19 showed higher and/or lower prominent differential expression in songbird vocal nuclei relative to the surrounding brain subdivisions in which the vocal nuclei are located. This included relatively lower levels of all four AMPA subunits in lMAN, strikingly higher levels of the kainite subunit GluR5 in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), higher and lower levels respectively of the NMDA subunits NR2A and NR2B in most vocal nuclei and lower levels of the metabotropic group I subtypes (mGluR1 and -5) in most vocal nuclei and the group II subtype (mGluR2), showing a unique expression pattern of very low levels in RA and very high levels in HVC. The splice variants of AMPA subunits showed further differential expression in vocal nuclei. Some of the receptor subunits/subtypes also showed differential expression in hummingbird and parrot vocal nuclei. The magnitude of differential expression in vocal nuclei of all three vocal learners was unique compared with the smaller magnitude of differences found for nonvocal areas of vocal learners and vocal nonlearners. Our results suggest that evolution of vocal learning was accompanied by differential expression of a conserved gene family for synaptic transmission and plasticity in vocal nuclei. They also suggest that neural activity and signal transduction in vocal nuclei of vocal learners will be different relative to the surrounding brain areas.},

abstract = {Musician's dystonia (MD) is a task-specific movement disorder characterized by a loss of voluntary motor control in highly trained movements like piano playing. Its underlying pathophysiology is defined by deficient functioning of neural pathways at different levels of the central nervous system. However, a few studies have examined the brain responses associated with executive functions such as error monitoring in MD. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) in professional pianists during the performance of memorized music sequences at fast tempi. Event-related potentials (ERPs) locked to pitch errors were investigated in MD and a control group. In MD patients, significantly larger error-related brain responses before and following errors were observed as compared with healthy pianists. Our results suggest that in MD, the generalized degraded neural activity at all levels of the central nervous system is manifested in specific neural correlates of the executive functions that monitor an overlearned sensorimotor performance.},

However, the molecular signals required for the initiation of myelination are largely unknown. Ishibashi et al. report in this issue of Neuron that ATP released by axons as a result of electrical stimulation serves as an important myelination signal. Surprisingly, they found that ATP does not act directly on oligodendrocytes but rather on astrocytes, causing the release of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which in turns affects promyelinating oligodendrocytes. These findings uncover a novel role for astrocytes in mediating the intricate communication between axons and myelinating glial cells.},

abstract = {The study of patients to infer normal brain function has a long tradition in neurology and psychology. More recently, the motor system has been subject to quantitative and computational characterization. The purpose of this review is to argue that the lesion approach and theoretical motor control can mutually inform each other. Specifically, one may identify distinct motor control processes from computational models and map them onto specific deficits in patients. Here we review some of the impairments in motor control, motor learning and higher-order motor control in patients with lesions of the corticospinal tract, the cerebellum, parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the medial temporal lobe. We attempt to explain some of these impairments in terms of computational ideas such as state estimation, optimization, prediction, cost, and reward. We suggest that a function of the cerebellum is system identification: to build internal models that predict sensory outcome of motor commands and correct motor commands through internal feedback. A function of the parietal cortex is state estimation: to integrate the predicted proprioceptive and visual outcomes with sensory feedback to form a belief about how the commands affected the states of the body and the environment. A function of basal ganglia is related to optimal control: learning costs and rewards associated with sensory states and estimating the "cost-to-go" during execution of a motor task. Finally, functions of the primary and the premotor cortices are related to implementing the optimal control policy by transforming beliefs about proprioceptive and visual states, respectively, into motor commands.},

abstract = {Male Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) sing a unique, stereotyped song that they learn from a tutor during development. A set of interconnected areas of the brain work together so that the birds can perceive, learn and produce song. In this review, we introduce the major components of the song system and describe evidence for how each might contribute to these three aspects of song. In particular, we highlight studies that have measured patterns of gene expression in the song system. These experiments clarify the structural organisation, and reveal functional activities, of the neural system underlying vocal communication. The utility of gene expression studies has been greatly enhanced with the release of the Zebra Finch genome. Investigation of gene expression in the song system will therefore continue to be a powerful way to connect the workings of this neural circuit with the behaviour of song. 'Zebra Finches sing a soft song that sounds squeaky and cheerful to the human ear and, perhaps, more mechanical than musical.' (Richard Zann, 'The Zebra Finch', 1996)},

Information on the spatial distribution and labeling of stained cells provides for a classification of ZENK patterns that (1) accords to the organization of stimuli into families, (2) preserves the stimuli intrafamily relationships, and (3) confers salience to natural over artificial stimuli, resulting in a nonclassical tonotopic map. Moreover, complex syllable maps cannot be reduced to any linear combinations of simple syllable maps. These properties arise from the collective response of NCM neurons to auditory stimuli, rather than from the behavior of single neurons. The syllabic representation described here may constitute an important step toward deciphering the rules of birdsong auditory representation.},

@article{Dadda2010,
abstract = {The habenulae are part of an evolutionary conserved conduction system that connects the limbic forebrain areas with midbrain structures and is implicated in important functions such as feeding, mating, avoidance learning, and hormonal response to stress. Very early during zebrafish neurogenesis the parapineal organ migrates near to one habenula, commonly the left, inducing wide left-right habenular asymmetries in gene expression and connectivity. It was posited that this initial symmetry-breaking event determines the development of lateralized brain functions and early differences in epithalamic left-right asymmetry give rise to individual variation in coping styles and personality. We tested these two hypotheses by sorting zebrafish with left or right parapineal at birth using a foxD3:GFP marker and by measuring visual and motor laterality and three personality dimensions as they become adults. Significant differences between fish with opposite parapineal position were found in all laterality tests while the influence of asymmetry of the habenulae on personality was more complex. Fish with atypical right parapineal position, tended to be bolder when inspecting a predator, spent less time in the peripheral portion of an open field and covered a shorter distance when released in the dark. Activity in the open field was not associated to anatomical asymmetry but correlated with laterality of predator inspection that in turn was influenced by parapineal position. One personality dimension, sociality, appeared uncorrelated to both anatomical and functional asymmetries and was instead influenced by the sex of the fish, thus suggesting that other factors, i.e. hormonal, may be implicated in its development.},

abstract = {We examine the question of which aspects of language are uniquely human and uniquely linguistic in light of recent suggestions by Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch that the only such aspect is syntactic recursion, the rest of language being either specific to humans but not to language (e.g. words and concepts) or not specific to humans (e.g. speech perception). We find the hypothesis problematic. It ignores the many aspects of grammar that are not recursive, such as phonology, morphology, case, agreement, and many properties of words. It is inconsistent with the anatomy and neural control of the human vocal tract. And it is weakened by experiments suggesting that speech perception cannot be reduced to primate audition, that word learning cannot be reduced to fact learning, and that at least one gene involved in speech and language was evolutionarily selected in the human lineage but is not specific to recursion. The recursion-only claim, we suggest, is motivated by Chomsky's recent approach to syntax, the Minimalist Program, which de-emphasizes the same aspects of language. The approach, however, is sufficiently problematic that it cannot be used to support claims about evolution. We contest related arguments that language is not an adaptation, namely that it is "perfect," non-redundant, unusable in any partial form, and badly designed for communication. The hypothesis that language is a complex adaptation for communication which evolved piecemeal avoids all these problems.},

The beta activity decreased after each tone, followed by an increase, thus forming a periodic modulation synchronized with the stimulus. The beta decrease was absent after omissions. In contrast, gamma-band activity showed a peak after tone and omission, suggesting underlying endogenous anticipatory processes. We propose that auditory beta and gamma oscillations have different roles in musical beat encoding and auditory-motor interaction.},

Quantifying the similarity between two songs, however, can be difficult and fraught with subjective bias. We present a fully automated procedure that measures parametrically the similarity between songs. We tested its performance on a large database of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, songs. The procedure uses an analytical framework of modern spectral analysis to characterize the acoustic structure of a song. This analysis provides a superior sound spectrogram that is then reduced to a set of simple acoustic features. Based on these features, the procedure detects similar sections between songs automatically. In addition, the procedure can be used to examine: (1) imitation accuracy across acoustic features; (2) song development; (3) the effect of brain lesions on specific song features; and (4) variability across different renditions of a song or a call produced by the same individual, across individuals and across populations. By making the procedure available we hope to promote the adoption of a standard, automated method for measuring similarity between songs or calls.

However, understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic action of DBS remains elusive. The goal of this review is to address our present knowledge of the effects of high-frequency stimulation within the central nervous system and comment on the functional implications of this knowledge for uncovering the mechanism(s) of DBS. Four general hypotheses have been developed to explain the mechanism(s) of DBS: depolarization blockade, synaptic inhibition, synaptic depression, and stimulation-induced modulation of pathological network activity. Using the results from functional imaging, neurochemistry, neural recording, and neural modeling experiments we address the general hypotheses and attempt to reconcile what have been considered conflicting results from these different research modalities. Our analysis suggests stimulation-induced modulation of pathological network activity represents the most likely mechanism of DBS; however, several open questions remain to explicitly link the effects of DBS with therapeutic outcomes.},

abstract = {The olivocerebellar climbing fiber projection pattern is closely correlated with the pattern of aldolase C expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Based on this expression pattern, the olivocerebellar projection can be classified into five "groups" of functional compartments. Each group originates from a subarea within the inferior olive that projects to multiple cortical stripes of Purkinje cells, all of which are either aldolase C positive or aldolase C negative. However, no equivalent compartmental organization has been demonstrated in the cerebellar nuclei (CN). Thus, in the CN of the rat, we systematically mapped the location of olivonuclear projections belonging to the five groups and determined their relationship to the expression of aldolase C in Purkinje cell axonal terminals. The CN were divided into caudoventral aldolase C-positive and rostrodorsal aldolase C-negative parts. The olivonuclear terminations from the five groups projected topographically to five separate compartments within the CN that partly crossed the traditional boundaries that define the fastigial, interposed, and dentate nuclei. Each compartment had mostly uniform cytoarchitecture and the same aldolase C expression (either positive or negative) that was found in the corresponding olivocortical projection. These results suggest a new view of the organization of the CN whereby the pattern of olivonuclear terminations links portions of different CN together. We propose that each compartment in the CN, along with its corresponding olivary subarea and cortical stripes, may be related to a different aspect of motor control.},

abstract = {Vitamin A is known to be critical for the beginning of eye development as well as for photoreception in the functional retina. Hardly anything, however, is known about whether retinoic acid (RA)-regulated gene expression also plays a role in the long intervening period, during which the neurobiological retinal structure takes shape. The eye contains a highly intricate architecture of RA-synthesizing (RALDH) and degrading (CYP26) enzymes. Whereas the RALDHs are integrated in the early molecular mechanisms through which the dorso-ventral retina organization is established, the CYP26 enzymes are not necessary for this process and no molecular targets that match their retinal expression pattern have yet been identified. In this article we describe that CYP26 expression in the mouse is most distinctive during later stages of retina formation. Throughout development CYP26A1 degrades RA in a horizontal region that extends across the retina, but during later embryonic and postnatal retina maturation this function is reinforced by another enzyme, CYP26C1. RA applications at this stage do not affect the RALDHs but cause differential changes in CYP26 expression: Cyp26a1 is up-regulated, but more rapidly by 9-cis than all-trans RA, Cyp26c1 is down-regulated, and Cyp26b1, which is undetectable in the normal mouse retina, is strongly activated in retinal ganglion cells. The dynamic regulation in RA-difference patterns by the CYP26 enzymes may set up spatial constellations for expression of genes involved in formation of retinal specializations for higher acuity vision, which are known to form over a prolonged period late in retina development.

This memory undergoes a period of consolidation after the training session, when it is sensitive to reversible inactivations of the cerebellar cortex, but not of the cerebellar nuclei, with the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol. Here, the temporal properties of this cerebellar cortex-dependent consolidation were examined using delayed infusions of muscimol in cortical lobule HVI. Cortical infusions delayed by 5 or 45 min after a conditioning session produced significant and very similar impairments of consolidation, but infusions delayed by 90 min produced little or no impairment. Behavioral measures indicate that the muscimol infusions produced significant effects after approximately 30 min and they lasted for a few hours. So, over a time window beginning approximately 1 hr after the end of the training session and closing 1 hr after that, intracortical activity is critical for consolidation of this motor memory.},

abstract = {In the brain, neuronal gene expression is dynamically changed in response to neuronal activity. In particular, the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) such as egr-1, c-fos, and Arc is rapidly and selectively upregulated in subsets of neurons in specific brain regions associated with learning and memory formation. IEG expression has therefore been widely used as a molecular marker for neuronal populations that undergo plastic changes underlying formation of long-term memory. In recent years, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic studies of neurons expressing c-fos or Arc have revealed that, during learning, IEG-positive neurons encode and store information that is required for memory recall, suggesting that they may be involved in formation of the memory trace. However, despite accumulating evidence for the role of IEGs in synaptic plasticity, the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with this process remain unclear. In this review, we first summarize recent literature concerning the role of IEG-expressing neuronal ensembles in organizing the memory trace. We then focus on the physiological significance of IEGs, especially Arc, in synaptic plasticity, and describe our hypotheses about the importance of Arc expression in various types of input-specific circuit reorganization. Finally, we offer perspectives on Arc function that would unveil the role of IEG-expressing neurons in the formation of memory traces in the hippocampus and other brain areas.},

@article{Kotz2009,
abstract = {While the primary function of the basal ganglia (BG) is linked to motor behaviour, several investigations of non-motor behaviour allocate cognitive and language-specific functions to the BG. What may such seemingly discrepant functions have in common? Some neurophysiologic theories of motor behaviour assign temporal sequencing, others the sequencing of general cognitive patterns to the BG. Turning to auditory language perception and syntax in particular, one may consider syntactic processing as a hierarchical sequencing phenomenon. Furthermore, previous data have shown that if events are predictable, the processing of successively following events in a sequence is facilitated. We propose that sequencing is closely linked to the perception of predictable cues (regular beats, meter, temporal chunks etc.). If this is the case, syntactic processing should rely on the extraction of predictable cues in auditory language perception. Consequently, dysfunctional extraction of such cues in BG patients should then lead to secondary deficits in syntactic processing as evidenced in recent behavioural and electrophysiological evidence (ERP). The fact that such "secondary syntactic deficits" can be compensated by external and speech inherent predictable cues permits two conclusions: (i) syntactic deficits in BG patients are epiphenomenal, and (ii) sequencing dysfunctions of the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA)-BG circuit may be compensated by increased influence of the cerebellar-thalamic-pre-SMA pathway. In the current review we elaborate on this possibility drawing comparisons to similar proposals in motor and language production.},

abstract = {Despite the highly conserved circuitry of the cerebellum, its overall shape varies significantly among and within vertebrate classes. In birds, one of the most prominent differences among orders is the relative size of the cerebellar folia. The enlargement/reduction of individual folia is thought to relate to specific behavioral differences among taxa, but this has not been adequately tested. Here, we survey variation in cerebellar folia size among 96 species of birds and test for phylogenetic effects and correlations with behavior using a combination of conventional and phylogeny-based statistics. Overall, we found that phylogenetic history accounts for a significant amount of variation in the relative size of individual folia. Order membership, in particular, accounted for more than half of the interspecific variation in folia size. There are also complex relationships among folia such that the expansion of one folium is often accompanied by a reduction in other folia. With respect to behavioral correlates: (1) we did not find any significant correlations between folia size and reliance on trigeminal input; (2) there was some evidence supporting a correlation between strong hindlimbs and an expansion of the anterior lobe; and (3) there were significant reductions in folia I-III and expansions in folia VI and VII in species classified as strong fliers. This expansion likely reflects increased visual processing requirements in species with rapid and/or agile flight. It therefore appears that folium size is a product of both phylogenetic history and behavior in birds.},

abstract = {How the brain selects one action from among multiple options is unknown. A main tenet of signal detection theory (SDT) is that sensory stimuli are represented as noisy information channels. Therefore, the accuracy of selection might be predicted by how well neuronal activity representing alternatives can be distinguished. Here, we apply an SDT framework to a motor system by recording from superior colliculus (SC) neurons during performance of a color, oddball selection task. We recorded from sets of four neurons simultaneously, each of the four representing one of the four possible targets. Because the electrode placement constrained the position of the stimuli in the visual field, the stimulus arrangement varied across experiments. This variability in stimulus arrangement led to variability in choices allowing us to explore the relationship between SC neuronal activity and performance accuracy. SC target neurons had higher levels of discharge than SC distractor neurons in subsets of trials when selection performance was very accurate. In subsets of trials when performance was poor, the discharge level decreased in target neurons and increased in distractor neurons. Accurate performance was associated with larger separations between neuronal activity from targets and distractors as quantified by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area and d′ (an index of discriminability). Poorer performance was associated with less separation of target and distractor neuronal activity. ROC area and d′ scaled approximately linearly with performance accuracy. Furthermore, ROC area and d′ increased as saccade onset approached. Together, the results indicate that SC buildup neuronal activity signals the saccadic eye movement decision.

abstract = {The final motor output underlying behavior arises from an appropriate balance between excitation and inhibition within neural networks. Retrograde signaling by endocannabinoids adapts synaptic strengths and the global activity of neural networks. In the spinal cord, endocannabinoids are mobilized postsynaptically from network neurons and act retrogradely on presynaptic cannabinoid receptors to potentiate the locomotor frequency. However, it is still unclear whether mechanisms exist within the locomotor networks that determine the sign of the modulation by cannabinoid receptors to differentially regulate excitation and inhibition. In this study, using the lamprey spinal cord in vitro, we first report that 2-AG (2-arachidonyl glycerol) is mobilized by network neurons and underlies a form of modulation that is embedded within the locomotor networks. We then show that the polarity of the endocannabinoid modulation is gated by nitric oxide to enable simultaneously potentiation of excitation and depression of inhibition within the spinal locomotor networks. Our results suggest that endocannabinoid and nitric oxide systems interact to mediate inversion of the polarity of synaptic plasticity within the locomotor networks. Thus, endocannabinoid and nitric oxide shift in the excitation-inhibition balance to set the excitability of the spinal locomotor network.},

Using rat and mouse hippocampal slices, we tested the hypothesis that tonic and phasic NO signals are needed and that they derive from different NO synthase isoforms. NMDA increased NO production in a manner that was potently inhibited by three different neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) inhibitors. Tonic NO could be monitored after sensitizing guanylyl cyclase-coupled NO receptors, allowing the very low ambient NO concentrations to be detected by cGMP measurement. The levels were unaffected by inhibition of NMDA receptors, nNOS, or the inducible NO synthase (iNOS). iNOS was also undetectable in protein or activity assays. Tonic NO was susceptible to agents inhibiting endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and was missing in eNOS knock-out mice. The eNOS knock-outs exhibited a deficiency in LTP resembling that seen in wild-types treated with a NO synthase inhibitor. LTP in the knock-outs could be fully restored by supplying a low level of NO exogenously. Inhibition of nNOS also caused a major loss of LTP, particularly of late-LTP. Again, exogenous NO could compensate, but higher concentrations were needed compared with those restoring LTP in the eNOS knock-outs. It is concluded that tonic and phasic NO signals are both required for hippocampal LTP and the two are generated, respectively, by eNOS and nNOS, the former in blood vessels and the latter in neurons.},

abstract = {Mate-choice decisions can be experience dependent, but we know little about how the brain processes stimuli that release such decisions. Female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) prefer males with long-bout songs over males with short-bout songs, and show higher expression of the immediate early gene (IEG) ZENK in the auditory forebrain when exposed to long-bout songs than when exposed to short-bout songs. We exposed female starlings to a short-day photoperiod for one of three durations and then, on an increased photophase, exposed them to one week of long-bout or short-bout song experience. We then examined their IEG response to novel long-bout versus novel short-bout songs by quantifying ZENK protein in two song-processing areas: the caudo-medial hyperstriatum ventrale and the caudo-medial neostriatum. ZENK expression in both areas increased with tenure on short-day photoperiods, suggesting that short days sensitize females to song. The ZENK response bias toward long-bout songs was greater in females with long-bout experience than in females with short-bout experience, indicating that the forebrain response bias toward a preferred trait depends on recent experience with that category of trait. This surprising level of neuroplasticity is immediately relevant to the natural history and fitness of the organism, and may underlie a mechanism for optimizing mate-choice criteria amidst locally variable distributions of secondary sexual characteristics.},

abstract = {Animals exploit visual information to identify objects, form stimulus-reward associations, and prepare appropriate behavioral responses. The nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), an associative region of the avian endbrain, contains neurons exhibiting prominent response modulation during presentation of reward-predicting visual stimuli, but it is unclear whether neural activity represents valuation signals, stimulus properties, or sensorimotor contingencies. To test the hypothesis that NCL neurons represent stimulus value, we subjected pigeons to a Pavlovian sign-tracking paradigm in which visual cues predicted rewards differing in magnitude (large vs. small) and delay to presentation (short vs. long). Subjects' strength of conditioned responding to visual cues reliably differentiated between predicted reward types and thus indexed valuation. The majority of NCL neurons discriminated between visual cues, with discriminability peaking shortly after stimulus onset and being maintained at lower levels throughout the stimulus presentation period. However, while some cells' firing rates correlated with reward value, such neurons were not more frequent than expected by chance. Instead, neurons formed discernible clusters which differed in their preferred visual cue. We propose that this activity pattern constitutes a prerequisite for using visual information in more complex situations e.g. requiring valuebased choices.},

abstract = {The generality of findings implicating secondary auditory areas in auditory imagery was tested by using a timbre imagery task with fMRI. Another aim was to test whether activity in supplementary motor area (SMA) seen in prior studies might have been related to subvocalization. Participants with moderate musical background were scanned while making similarity judgments about the timbre of heard or imagined musical instrument sounds. The critical control condition was a visual imagery task. The pattern of judgments in perceived and imagined conditions was similar, suggesting that perception and imagery access similar cognitive representations of timbre. As expected, judgments of heard timbres, relative to the visual imagery control, activated primary and secondary auditory areas with some right-sided asymmetry. Timbre imagery also activated secondary auditory areas relative to the visual imagery control, although less strongly, in accord with previous data. Significant overlap was observed in these regions between perceptual and imagery conditions. Because the visual control task resulted in deactivation of auditory areas relative to a silent baseline, we interpret the timbre imagery effect as a reversal of that deactivation. Despite the lack of an obvious subvocalization component to timbre imagery, some activity in SMA was observed, suggesting that SMA may have a more general role in imagery beyond any motor component.},

This habituation is long lasting and specific to individual stimuli. We here test the acoustic and ethological basis of this stimulus-specific habituation by recording extracellular multiunit activity in the NCM of awake male and female zebra finches presented with a variety of conspecific and heterospecific vocalizations, white noise, and tones. Initial responses to conspecific song and calls and to human speech were higher than responses to the other stimuli. Immediate habituation rates were high for all novel stimuli except tones, which habituated at a lower rate. Habituation to conspecific calls and songs outlasted habituation to other stimuli. The extent of immediate habituation induced by a particular novel song was not diminished when other conspecific songs were presented in alternation. In addition, the persistence of habituation was not diminished by exposure to other songs before testing, nor was it influenced by gender or laterality. Our results suggest that the NCM is specialized for remembering the calls and songs of many individual conspecifics.},

abstract = {Implicit learning (IL) occurs unconsciously and without intention. Perceptual fluency is the ease of processing elicited by previous exposure to a stimulus. It has been assumed that perceptual fluency is associated with IL. However, the role of perceptual fluency following IL has not been investigated in temporal pattern learning. Two experiments by Schultz, Stevens, Keller, and Tillmann demonstrated the IL of auditory temporal patterns using a serial reaction-time task and a generation task based on the process dissociation procedure. The generation task demonstrated that learning was implicit in both experiments via motor fluency, that is, the inability to suppress learned information. With the aim to disentangle conscious and unconscious processes, we analyze unreported recognition data associated with the Schultz et al. experiments using the sequence identification measurement model. The model assumes that perceptual fluency reflects unconscious processes and IL. For Experiment 1, the model indicated that conscious and unconscious processes contributed to recognition of temporal patterns, but that unconscious processes had a greater influence on recognition than conscious processes. In the model implementation of Experiment 2, there was equal contribution of conscious and unconscious processes in the recognition of temporal patterns. As Schultz et al. demonstrated IL in both experiments using a generation task, and the conditions reported here in Experiments 1 and 2 were identical, two explanations are offered for the discrepancy in model and behavioral results based on the two tasks: 1) perceptual fluency may not be necessary to infer IL, or 2) conscious control over implicitly learned information may vary as a function of perceptual fluency and motor fluency.},

abstract = {Several forms of learning, including classical conditioning of the eyeblink, depend upon the cerebellum. In examining mechanisms of eyeblink conditioning in rabbits, reversible inactivations of the control circuitry have begun to dissociate aspects of cerebellar cortical and nuclear function in memory consolidation. It was previously shown that post-training cerebellar cortical, but not nuclear, inactivations with the GABAA agonist muscimol prevented consolidation but these findings left open the question as to how final memory storage was partitioned across cortical and nuclear levels. Memory consolidation might be essentially cortical and directly disturbed by actions of the muscimol, or it might be nuclear, and sensitive to the raised excitability of the nuclear neurons following the loss of cortical inhibition. To resolve this question, we simultaneously inactivated cerebellar cortical lobule HVI and the anterior interpositus nucleus of rabbits during the post-training period, so protecting the nuclei from disinhibitory effects of cortical inactivation. Consolidation was impaired by these simultaneous inactivations. Because direct application of muscimol to the nuclei alone has no impact upon consolidation, we can conclude that post-training, consolidation processes and memory storage for eyeblink conditioning have critical cerebellar cortical components. The findings are consistent with a recent model that suggests the distribution of learning-related plasticity across cortical and nuclear levels is task-dependent. There can be transfer to nuclear or brainstem levels for control of high-frequency responses but learning with lower frequency response components, such as in eyeblink conditioning, remains mainly dependent upon cortical memory storage.},

abstract = {Both avian and mammalian basal ganglia are involved in voluntary motor control. In birds, such movements include hopping, perching and flying. Two organizational features that distinguish the songbird basal ganglia are that striatal and pallidal neurons are intermingled, and that neurons dedicated to vocal-motor function are clustered together in a dense cell group known as area X that sits within the surrounding striato-pallidum. This specification allowed us to perform molecular profiling of two striato-pallidal subregions, comparing transcriptional patterns in tissue dedicated to vocal-motor function (area X) to those in tissue that contains similar cell types but supports non-vocal behaviors: the striato-pallidum ventral to area X (VSP), our focus here. Since any behavior is likely underpinned by the coordinated actions of many molecules, we constructed gene co-expression networks from microarray data to study large-scale transcriptional patterns in both subregions. Our goal was to investigate any relationship between VSP network structure and singing and identify gene co-expression groups, or modules, found in the VSP but not area X. We observed mild, but surprising, relationships between VSP modules and song spectral features, and found a group of four VSP modules that were highly specific to the region. These modules were unrelated to singing, but were composed of genes involved in many of the same biological processes as those we previously observed in area X-specific singing-related modules. The VSP-specific modules were also enriched for processes disrupted in Parkinson's and Huntington's Diseases. Our results suggest that the activation/inhibition of a single pathway is not sufficient to functionally specify area X versus the VSP and support the notion that molecular processes are not in and of themselves specialized for behavior. Instead, unique interactions between molecular pathways create functional specificity in particular brain regions during distinct behavioral states.},

This event triggers the amplification of habenular asymmetries and the subsequent organisation of lateralised circuits in the interpeduncular nucleus.

Working memory includes two components: short-term storage (on the order of seconds) and executive processes that operate on the contents of storage. Recently, these two components have been investigated in functional neuroimaging studies. Studies of storage indicate that different frontal regions are activated for different kinds of information: storage for verbal materials activates Broca's area and left-hemisphere supplementary and premotor areas; storage of spatial information activates the right-hemisphere premotor cortex; and storage of object information activates other areas of the prefrontal cortex. Two of the fundamental executive processes are selective attention and task management. Both processes activate the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.},

With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation of calcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal NO signaling could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.},

One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

abstract = {Disorders of music and speech perception, known as amusia and aphasia, have traditionally been regarded as dissociated deficits based on studies of brain damaged patients. This has been taken as evidence that music and speech are perceived by largely separate and independent networks in the brain. However, recent studies of congenital amusia have broadened this view by showing that the deficit is associated with problems in perceiving speech prosody, especially intonation and emotional prosody. In the present study the association between the perception of music and speech prosody was investigated with healthy Finnish adults (n = 61) using an on-line music perception test including the Scale subtest of Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) and Off-Beat and Out-of-key tasks as well as a prosodic verbal task that measures the perception of word stress. Regression analyses showed that there was a clear association between prosody perception and music perception, especially in the domain of rhythm perception. This association was evident after controlling for music education, age, pitch perception, visuospatial perception, and working memory. Pitch perception was significantly associated with music perception but not with prosody perception. The association between music perception and visuospatial perception (measured using analogous tasks) was less clear. Overall, the pattern of results indicates that there is a robust link between music and speech perception and that this link can be mediated by rhythmic cues (time and stress).},

By contrast, the 'How?' of motion sickness is better understood in terms of mechanisms (e.g., 'sensory conflict' or similar) and stimulus properties (e.g., acceleration, frequency, duration, visual-vestibular time-lag). Factors governing motion sickness susceptibility may be divided broadly into two groups: (i) those related to the stimulus (motion type and provocative property of stimulus); and (ii) those related to the individual person (habituation or sensitisation, individual differences, protective behaviours, administration of anti-motion sickness drugs). The aim of this paper is to review some of the more important factors governing motion sickness susceptibility, with an emphasis on the personal rather than physical stimulus factors.},

abstract = {The songbird area X is a basal ganglia homolog that contains two pallidal cell types-local neurons that project within the basal ganglia and output neurons that project to the thalamus. Based on these projections, it has been proposed that these classes are structurally homologous to the primate external (GPe) and internal (GPi) pallidal segments. To test the hypothesis that the two area X pallidal types are functionally homologous to GPe and GPi neurons, we recorded from neurons in area X of singing juvenile male zebra finches, and directly compared their firing patterns to neurons recorded in the primate pallidus. In area X, we found two cell classes that exhibited high firing (HF) rates ({\textgreater}60 Hz) characteristic of pallidal neurons. HF-1 neurons, like most GPe neurons we examined, exhibited large firing rate modulations, including bursts and long pauses. In contrast, HF-2 neurons, like GPi neurons, discharged continuously without bursts or long pauses. To test whether HF-2 neurons were the output neurons that project to the thalamus, we next recorded directly from pallidal axon terminals in thalamic nucleus DLM, and found that all terminals exhibited singing-related firing patterns indistinguishable from HF-2 neurons. Our data show that singing-related neural activity distinguishes two putative pallidal cell types in area X: thalamus-projecting neurons that exhibit activity similar to the primate GPi, and non-thalamus-projecting neurons that exhibit activity similar to the primate GPe. These results suggest that song learning in birds and motor learning in mammals use conserved basal ganglia signaling strategies.},

abstract = {The songbird brain is able to discriminate between the bird's own song and other conspecific songs. Determining where in the brain own- song selectivity emerges is of great importance because experience-dependent mechanisms are necessarily involved and because brain regions sensitive to self-generated vocalizations could mediate auditory feedback that is necessary for song learning and maintenance. Using functional MRI, here we show that this selectivity is present at the midbrain level. Surprisingly, the selectivity was found to be lateralized toward the right side, a finding reminiscent of the potential right lateralization of song production in zebra finches but also of own-face and own-voice recognition in human beings. These results indicate that a midbrain structure can process subtle information about the identity of a subject through experience-dependent mechanisms, challenging the classical perception of subcortical regions as primitive and nonplastic structures. They also open questions about the evolution of the cognitive skills and lateralization in vertebrates.},

The recent recognition that they are organized in separate territories and possess active properties--notably a competence for the regulated release of 'gliotransmitters', including glutamate--has enabled us to develop an understanding of previously unknown functions for astrocytes. Today, astrocytes are seen as local communication elements of the brain that can generate various regulatory signals and bridge structures (from neuronal to vascular) and networks that are otherwise disconnected from each other. Examples of their specific and essential roles in normal physiological processes have begun to accumulate, and the number of diseases known to involve defective astrocytes is increasing.},

abstract = {In vivo cell lineage-tracing studies in the vertebrate retina have revealed that the sizes and cellular compositions of retinal clones are highly variable. It has been challenging to ascertain whether this variability reflects distinct but reproducible lineages among many different retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) or is the product of stochastic fate decisions operating within a population of more equivalent RPCs. To begin to distinguish these possibilities, we developed a method for long-term videomicroscopy to follow the lineages of rat perinatal RPCs cultured at clonal density. In such cultures, cell-cell interactions between two different clones are eliminated and the extracellular environment is kept constant, allowing us to study the cell-intrinsic potential of a given RPC. Quantitative analysis of the reconstructed lineages showed that the mode of division of RPCs is strikingly consistent with a simple stochastic pattern of behavior in which the decision to multiply or differentiate is set by fixed probabilities. The variability seen in the composition and order of cell type genesis within clones is well described by assuming that each of the four different retinal cell types generated at this stage is chosen stochastically by differentiating neurons, with relative probabilities of each type set by their abundance in the mature retina. Although a few of the many possible combinations of cell types within clones occur at frequencies that are incompatible with a fully stochastic model, our results support the notion that stochasticity has a major role during retinal development and therefore possibly in other parts of the central nervous system.},

abstract = {In recent years, the use of operant conditioning procedures has shown that species as diverse as chimpanzees, honeybees, and mosquitofish can be trained to discriminate between sets containing different numbers of objects. However, to succeed in this task, subjects can use two different strategies: either select the array containing a specific number of items (an absolute numerosity rule), or select the set containing the larger (or smaller) quantity of items (a relative numerosity rule). In the latter case, subjects need not only be able to judge whether two numerosities are equal or different but also be able to order numerosities. Here, in two experiments, we address whether fish can perform both kinds of judgment by training them with specific numerosities and testing their generalization to new numerosity contrasts. In Experiment 1, subjects were initially trained to select between visual arrays of 6 and 12 shapes, and were then tested with a contrast pairing the previously trained numerosity (either 6 or 12) with a novel numerosity (respectively, 3 or 24). Spontaneously, subjects selected the novel numerosity, in accordance with a relative numerosity rule. The second experiment tested whether guppies can also learn to select one specific number against all others, if appropriately trained. Fish trained to select an array of 4 shapes against several alternatives (4 vs. 1, 4 vs. 2, 4 vs. 8, 4 vs. 10) learned to recognize the number 4 against all alternatives and proved able to generalize their discrimination to novel, more difficult contrasts (4 vs. 3 and 4 vs. 6 items). In summary, although guppies preferentially opt for relative comparisons, they can flexibly learn either relative or absolute decision criteria on numerosity stimuli, depending on the context.},

abstract = {The acquisition of complex motor sequences often proceeds through trial-and-error learning, requiring the deliberate exploration of motor actions and the concomitant evaluation of the resulting performance. Songbirds learn their song in this manner, producing highly variable vocalizations as juveniles. As the song improves, vocal variability is gradually reduced until it is all but eliminated in adult birds. In the present study we examine how the motor program underlying such a complex motor behavior evolves during learning by recording from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), a motor cortex analog brain region. In young birds, neurons in RA exhibited highly variable firing patterns that throughout development became more precise, sparse, and bursty. We further explored how the developing motor program in RA is shaped by its two main inputs: LMAN, the output nucleus of a basal ganglia-forebrain circuit, and HVC, a premotor nucleus. Pharmacological inactivation of LMAN during singing made the song-aligned firing patterns of RA neurons adultlike in their stereotypy without dramatically affecting the spike statistics or the overall firing patterns. Removing the input from HVC, on the other hand, resulted in a complete loss of stereotypy of both the song and the underlying motor program. Thus our results show that a basal ganglia-forebrain circuit drives motor exploration required for trial-and-error learning by adding variability to the developing motor program. As learning proceeds and the motor circuits mature, the relative contribution of LMAN is reduced, allowing the premotor input from HVC to drive an increasingly stereotyped song.},

Recent progress in this field is revealing that a highly ordered series of events, involving cell-cell communication, localized signaling and stochastic choices, creates a complex mosaic of PRs that is reminiscent of the human retina. Notably, several of the factors used in generating the retinal mosaic of the fruitfly have corresponding functions in vertebrates that are likely to have similar roles.},

This induction was independent of auditory feedback, since it occurred in deafened birds that sang. Double-labeling studies demonstrated that only one of the two sets of projection neurons in HVc expressed singing-related Fos. The motor-driven induction of Fos identifies functionally distinct cell populations in a network for singing and may point to sites of cellular plasticity necessary for song maintenance.},

abstract = {The cerebellum is a crucial structure involved in movement control and cognitive processing. Noninvasive stimulation of the cerebellum results in neurophysiological and behavioral changes, an effect that has been attributed to modulation of cerebello-brain connectivity. At rest, the cerebellum exerts an overall inhibitory tone over the primary motor cortex (M1), cerebello-brain inhibition (CBI), likely through dentate-thalamo-cortical connections. The level of excitability of this pathway before and after stimulation of the cerebellum, however, has not been directly investigated. In this study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine changes in M1, brainstem, and CBI before and after 25 min of anodal, cathodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right cerebellar cortex. We hypothesized that anodal tDCS would result in an enhancement of CBI and cathodal would decrease it, relative to sham stimulation. We found that cathodal tDCS resulted in a clear decrease of CBI, whereas anodal tDCS increased it, in the absence of changes after sham stimulation. These effects were specific to the cerebello-cortical connections with no changes in other M1 or brainstem excitability measures. The cathodal effect on CBI was found to be dependent on stimulation intensity and lasted up to 30 min after the cessation of tDCS. These results suggest that tDCS can modulate in a focal and polarity-specific manner cerebellar excitability, likely through changes in Purkinje cell activity. Therefore, direct current stimulation of the cerebellum may have significant potential implications for patients with cerebellar dysfunction as well as to motor control studies.},

abstract = {Drosophila colour vision is achieved by R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells present in every ommatidium. The fly retina contains two types of ommatidia, called 'pale' and 'yellow', defined by different rhodopsin pairs expressed in R7 and R8 cells. Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless.},

abstract = {A young male zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) learns to sing by copying the vocalizations of an older tutor in a process that parallels human speech acquisition. Brain pathways that control song production are well defined, but little is known about the sites and mechanisms of tutor song memorization. Here we test the hypothesis that molecular signaling in a sensory brain area outside of the song system is required for developmental song learning. Using controlled tutoring and a pharmacological inhibitor, we transiently suppressed the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway in a portion of the auditory forebrain specifically during tutor song exposure. On maturation, treated birds produced poor copies of tutor song, whereas controls copied the tutor song effectively. Thus the foundation of normal song learning, the formation of a sensory memory of tutor song, requires a conserved molecular pathway in a brain area that is distinct from the circuit for song motor control.},

abstract = {The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), which controls childbirth and lactation, receives increasing attention for its effects on social behaviors, but how it reaches central brain regions is still unclear. Here we gained by recombinant viruses selective genetic access to hypothalamic OT neurons to study their connectivity and control their activity by optogenetic means. We found axons of hypothalamic OT neurons in the majority of forebrain regions, including the central amygdala (CeA), a structure critically involved in OT-mediated fear suppression. In vitro, exposure to blue light of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing OT axons activated a local GABAergic circuit that inhibited neurons in the output region of the CeA. Remarkably, in vivo, local blue-light-induced endogenous OT release robustly decreased freezing responses in fear-conditioned rats. Our results thus show widespread central projections of hypothalamic OT neurons and demonstrate that OT release from local axonal endings can specifically control region-associated behaviors.},

abstract = {Human dance was investigated with positron emission tomography to identify its systems-level organization. Three core aspects of dance were examined: entrainment, meter and patterned movement. Amateur dancers performed small-scale, cyclically repeated tango steps on an inclined surface to the beat of tango music, without visual guidance. Entrainment of dance steps to music, compared to self-pacing of movement, was supported by anterior cerebellar vermis. Movement to a regular, metric rhythm, compared to movement to an irregular rhythm, implicated the right putamen in the voluntary control of metric motion. Spatial navigation of leg movement during dance, when controlling for muscle contraction, activated the medial superior parietal lobule, reflecting proprioceptive and somatosensory contributions to spatial cognition in dance. Finally, additional cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions were active at the systems level. Consistent with recent work on simpler, rhythmic, motor-sensory behaviors, these data reveal the interacting network of brain areas active during spatially patterned, bipedal, rhythmic movements that are integrated in dance.},

abstract = {A new method for calculating auditory excitation patterns and loudness for steady sounds is described. The method is based on a nonlinear filterbank in which each filter is the sum of a broad passive filter and a sharp active filter. All filters have a rounded-exponential shape. For each center frequency (CF), the gain of the active filter is controlled by the output of the passive filter. The parameters of the model were derived from large sets of previously published notched-noise masking data obtained from human subjects. Excitation patterns derived using the new filterbank include the effects of basilar membrane compression. Loudness can be calculated as the area under the excitation pattern when plotted in intensity-like units on an ERB(N)-number (Cam) scale; no transformation from excitation to specific loudness is required. The method predicts the standard equal-loudness contours and loudness as a function of bandwidth with good accuracy. With some additional assumptions, the method also gives reasonably accurate predictions of partial loudness.},

Some have contended that because operant and respondent processes share a number of similarities, the distinction should be dropped. Others, for lack of a better theoretical alternative, have supported the continued distinction. It is suggested that the failure of behavior analysts to recognize the ever-present role of respondent relations in operant conditioning experiments may be impeding the formulation of an effective explanation for stimulus equivalence, which has been investigated primarily as an operant phenomenon. Conceptual issues historically relevant to the operant-respondent distinction are discussed, and equivalence researchers are urged to consider the involvement of both classes of behavior in their analyses.

abstract = {Our perception of time is affected by the modality in which it is conveyed. Moreover, certain temporal phenomena appear to exist in only one modality. The perception of temporal regularity or structure (e.g., the 'beat') in rhythmic patterns is one such phenomenon: visual beat perception is rare. The modality-specificity for beat perception is puzzling, as the durations that comprise rhythmic patterns are much longer than the limits of visual temporal resolution. Moreover, the optimization that beat perception provides for memory of auditory sequences should be equally relevant to visual sequences. Why does beat perception appear to be modality specific? One possibility is that the nature of the visual stimulus plays a role. Previous studies have usually used brief stimuli (e.g., light flashes) to present visual rhythms. In the current study, a rotating line that appeared sequentially in different spatial orientations was used to present a visual rhythm. Discrimination accuracy for visual rhythms and auditory rhythms was compared for different types of rhythms. The rhythms either had a regular temporal structure that previously has been shown to induce beat perception in the auditory modality, or they had an irregular temporal structure without beat-inducing qualities. Overall, the visual rhythms were discriminated more poorly than the auditory rhythms. The beat-based structure, however, increased accuracy for visual as well as auditory rhythms. These results indicate that beat perception can occur in the visual modality and improve performance on a temporal discrimination task, when certain types of stimuli are used.},

For the critical case of language, conflicting answers arise from the neuropsychological literature, which features striking dissociations between deficits in linguistic and nonlinguistic abilities, vs. the neuroimaging literature, which has argued for overlap between activations for linguistic and nonlinguistic processes, including arithmetic, domain general abilities like cognitive control, and music. Here, we use functional MRI to define classic language regions functionally in each subject individually and then examine the response of these regions to the nonlinguistic functions most commonly argued to engage these regions: arithmetic, working memory, cognitive control, and music. We find little or no response in language regions to these nonlinguistic functions. These data support a clear distinction between language and other cognitive processes, resolving the prior conflict between the neuropsychological and neuroimaging literatures.},

abstract = {Attentional inhibition that occurs during discrimination tasks leads to the negative evaluation of distractor stimuli. This phenomenon, known as the distractor devaluation effect also occurs when go/no-go tasks require response inhibition. However, it remains unclear whether there are interactions between attention and response controls when the distractor devaluation effect occurs. The aims of this study were to investigate whether attention to stimuli in the go/no-go task plays a facilitative role in distractor devaluation through response inhibition, and to clarify whether this effect reflects a decreased preference for no-go stimuli. Participants evaluated the preference for pictures before and after a go/no-go task. In Experiments 1 and 2, they made a go or no-go response depending on the category of pictures displayed (gummy candies or rice crackers), whereas in Experiment 3 they did on the basis digit category, even or odd numbers, superimposed on such pictures. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that the pictures presented as no-go stimuli in the preceding go/no-go task were evaluated as less positive than the pictures presented as go stimuli. This devaluation effect reflected an increased preference for the go stimuli but not a decreased preference for the no-go stimuli. Experiment 3 indicated that response inhibition did not affect the preference for the pictures that had not received attention in a preceding go/no-go task. These results suggest that although attention plays an important role in differential ratings for go and no-go stimuli, such differences, in fact, reflect the valuation of go stimuli. },

The present experiments aimed to determine whether listeners actually perceive such rhythmic differences in a purely musical context (i.e., in instrumental music without words). In Experiment 1a, listeners successfully classified instrumental renditions of French and English songs having highly contrastive rhythmic differences. Experiment 1b replicated this result with the same songs containing rhythmic information only. In Experiments 2a and 2b, listeners successfully classified original and rhythm-only stimuli when language-specific rhythmic differences were less contrastive but more representative of differences found in actual music and speech. These findings indicate that listeners can use rhythmic similarities and differences to classify songs originally composed in two languages having contrasting rhythmic prosody.},

Correlational analyses showed that nonlinear measures assessed during auditory oddball performance were reliably related to an independently assessed measure of perceptual speed. We conclude that cortical dynamics during rest and stimulus processing undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to old age, and propose that lifespan age differences in nonlinear dynamics during stimulus processing reflect lifespan changes in the functional organization of neuronal cell assemblies.},

abstract = {Language and arithmetic are both lateralized to the left hemisphere in the majority of right-handed adults. Yet, does this similar lateralization reflect a single overall constraint of brain organization, such an overall "dominance" of the left hemisphere for all linguistic and symbolic operations? Is it related to the lateralization of specific cerebral subregions? Or is it merely coincidental? To shed light on this issue, we performed a "colateralization analysis" over 209 healthy subjects: We investigated whether normal variations in the degree of left hemispheric asymmetry in areas involved in sentence listening and reading are mirrored in the asymmetry of areas involved in mental arithmetic. Within the language network, a region-of-interest analysis disclosed partially dissociated patterns of lateralization, inconsistent with an overall "dominance" model. Only two of these areas presented a lateralization during sentence listening and reading which correlated strongly with the lateralization of two regions active during calculation. Specifically, the profile of asymmetry in the posterior superior temporal sulcus during sentence processing covaried with the asymmetry of calculation-induced activation in the intraparietal sulcus, and a similar colateralization linked the middle frontal gyrus with the superior posterior parietal lobule. Given recent neuroimaging results suggesting a late emergence of hemispheric asymmetries for symbolic arithmetic during childhood, we speculate that these colateralizations might constitute developmental traces of how the acquisition of linguistic symbols affects the cerebral organization of the arithmetic network.},

abstract = {The frequency following response (FFR), a scalp-recorded measure of phase-locked brainstem activity, is often assumed to reflect the pitch of sounds as perceived by humans. In two experiments, we investigated the characteristics of the FFR evoked by complex tones. FFR waveforms to alternating-polarity stimuli were averaged for each polarity and added, to enhance envelope, or subtracted, to enhance temporal fine structure information. In experiment 1, frequency-shifted complex tones, with all harmonics shifted by the same amount in Hertz, were presented diotically. Only the autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of the subtraction-FFR waveforms showed a peak at a delay shifted in the direction of the expected pitch shifts. This expected pitch shift was also present in the ACFs of the output of an auditory nerve model. In experiment 2, the components of a harmonic complex with harmonic numbers 2, 3, and 4 were presented either to the same ear ("mono") or the third harmonic was presented contralaterally to the ear receiving the even harmonics ("dichotic"). In the latter case, a pitch corresponding to the missing fundamental was still perceived. Monaural control conditions presenting only the even harmonics ("2 + 4") or only the third harmonic ("3") were also tested. Both the subtraction and the addition waveforms showed that (1) the FFR magnitude spectra for "dichotic" were similar to the sum of the spectra for the two monaural control conditions and lacked peaks at the fundamental frequency and other distortion products visible for "mono" and (2) ACFs for "dichotic" were similar to those for "2 + 4" and dissimilar to those for "mono." The results indicate that the neural responses reflected in the FFR preserve monaural temporal information that may be important for pitch, but provide no evidence for any additional processing over and above that already present in the auditory periphery, and do not directly represent the pitch of dichotic stimuli.},

abstract = {Stroke is a leading cause of disability, but no pharmacological therapy is currently available for promoting recovery. The brain region adjacent to stroke damage-the peri-infarct zone-is critical for rehabilitation, as it shows heightened neuroplasticity, allowing sensorimotor functions to re-map from damaged areas. Thus, understanding the neuronal properties constraining this plasticity is important for the development of new treatments. Here we show that after a stroke in mice, tonic neuronal inhibition is increased in the peri-infarct zone. This increased tonic inhibition is mediated by extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and is caused by an impairment in GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) transporter (GAT-3/GAT-4) function. To counteract the heightened inhibition, we administered in vivo a benzodiazepine inverse agonist specific for $\alpha$5-subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors at a delay after stroke. This treatment produced an early and sustained recovery of motor function. Genetically lowering the number of $\alpha$5- or $\delta$-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors responsible for tonic inhibition also proved beneficial for recovery after stroke, consistent with the therapeutic potential of diminishing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Together, our results identify new pharmacological targets and provide the rationale for a novel strategy to promote recovery after stroke and possibly other brain injuries.},

abstract = {Sparse coding schemes are employed by many sensory systems and implement efficient coding principles. Yet, the computations yielding sparse representations are often only partly understood. The early auditory system of the grasshopper produces a temporally and population-sparse representation of natural communication signals. To reveal the computations generating such a code, we estimated 1D and 2D linear-nonlinear models. We then used these models to examine the contribution of different model components to response sparseness. 2D models were better able to reproduce the sparseness measured in the system: while 1D models only captured 55{\%} of the population sparseness at the network's output, 2D models accounted for 88{\%} of it. Looking at the model structure, we could identify two types of computation, which increase sparseness. First, a sensitivity to the derivative of the stimulus and, second, the combination of a fast, excitatory and a slow, suppressive feature. Both were implemented in different classes of cells and increased the specificity and diversity of responses. The two types produced more transient responses and thereby amplified temporal sparseness. Additionally, the second type of computation contributed to population sparseness by increasing the diversity of feature selectivity through a wide range of delays between an excitatory and a suppressive feature. Both kinds of computation can be implemented through spike-frequency adaptation or slow inhibition-mechanisms found in many systems. Our results from the auditory system of the grasshopper are thus likely to reflect general principles underlying the emergence of sparse representations.},

abstract = {In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb's rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.},

abstract = {Area X is a songbird basal ganglia nucleus that is required for vocal learning. Both Area X and its immediate surround, the medial striatum (MSt), contain cells displaying either striatal or pallidal characteristics. We used pathway-tracing techniques to compare directly the targets of Area X and MSt with those of the lateral striatum (LSt) and globus pallidus (GP). We found that the zebra finch LSt projects to the GP, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and pars compacta (SNc), but not the thalamus. The GP is reciprocally connected with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and projects to the SNr and motor thalamus analog, the ventral intermediate area (VIA). In contrast to the LSt, Area X and surrounding MSt project to the ventral pallidum (VP) and dorsal thalamus via pallidal-like neurons. A dorsal strip of the MSt contains spiny neurons that project to the VP. The MSt, but not Area X, projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and SNc, but neither MSt nor Area X projects to the SNr. Largely distinct populations of SNc and VTA dopaminergic neurons innervate Area X and surrounding the MSt. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with an indirect pathway from the cerebellum to the basal ganglia, including Area X. Area X projections thus differ from those of the GP and LSt, but are similar to those of the MSt. These data clarify the relationships among different portions of the oscine basal ganglia as well as among the basal ganglia of birds and mammals.},

"Undirected" song is not accompanied by the dance and is produced when the male is in the presence of other males, alone, or outside a nest occupied by its mate. Here, we show that the anterior forebrain vocal pathway contains medial and lateral "cortical-basal ganglia" subdivisions that have differential ZENK gene activation depending on whether the bird sings female-directed or undirected song. Differences also occur in the vocal output nucleus, RA. Thus, although these two vocal behaviors are very similar, their brain activation patterns are dramatically different.},

Time perception has traditionally been thought to be entirely dissociated from spatial vision. Here we show that the apparent duration of a dynamic stimulus can be manipulated in a local region of visual space by adapting to oscillatory motion or flicker. This implicates spatially localized temporal mechanisms in duration perception. We do not see concomitant changes in the time of onset or offset of the test patterns, demonstrating a direct local effect on duration perception rather than an indirect effect on the time course of neural processing. The effects of adaptation on duration perception can also be dissociated from motion or flicker perception per se. Although 20 Hz adaptation reduces both the apparent temporal frequency and duration of a 10 Hz test stimulus, 5 Hz adaptation increases apparent temporal frequency but has little effect on duration perception. We conclude that there is a peripheral, spatially localized, essentially visual component involved in sensing the duration of visual events.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Associative learning during Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning has been shown to be regulated by 5-HT2A receptors. The existence of inverse agonists that retard learning through an action at the 5-HT2A receptor suggests the existence of constitutive activity at that receptor and that depletion of serotonin should have minimal effects on learning.

OBJECTIVES: We examined whether depletion of serotonin would impair trace eyeblink conditioning or the enhancement of conditioning produced by the agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the retardation of conditioning produced by the inverse agonist MDL11,939.

METHODS: Animals received bilateral intraventricular injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) at doses of 760 or 1,140 microg/side (1.88 or 2.82 micromol/side) and were later exposed to eight daily conditioning sessions.

RESULTS: Serotonin depletion produced by the lower dose of 5,7-DHT was 71 and 72{\%} in cortex and hippocampus, respectively, with no change in 5-HT2A receptor density, no effect on learning, and no effect on the ability of LSD to enhance and MDL11,939 to retard learning. The higher dose of 5,7-DHT produced serotonin decreases of 85 and 90{\%} in cortex and hippocampus, respectively, accompanied by a 96{\%} decrease in the density of the serotonin transporter, but no significant effect on learning.

CONCLUSIONS: Pavlovian trace eyeblink conditioning is regulated predominantly by the constitutive activity of the 5-HT2A receptor rather than by serotonin release onto the receptor during learning. It was suggested that the 5-HT2A receptor regulates learning by modulating the release of dopamine, acetylcholine, and glutamate, transmitters known to affect eyeblink conditioning.},

abstract = {Feeling the beat and meter is fundamental to the experience of music. However, how these periodicities are represented in the brain remains largely unknown. Here, we test whether this function emerges from the entrainment of neurons resonating to the beat and meter. We recorded the electroencephalogram while participants listened to a musical beat and imagined a binary or a ternary meter on this beat (i.e., a march or a waltz). We found that the beat elicits a sustained periodic EEG response tuned to the beat frequency. Most importantly, we found that meter imagery elicits an additional frequency tuned to the corresponding metric interpretation of this beat. These results provide compelling evidence that neural entrainment to beat and meter can be captured directly in the electroencephalogram. More generally, our results suggest that music constitutes a unique context to explore entrainment phenomena in dynamic cognitive processing at the level of neural networks.},

abstract = {This study considered the contribution of dynamic attending theory (DAT) and attentional entrainment to systematic distortions in perceived event duration. Three experiments were conducted using an auditory oddball paradigm, in which listeners judged the duration of a deviant (oddball) stimulus embedded within a series of identical (standard) stimuli. To test for a role of attentional entrainment in perceived oddball duration, oddballs were presented at either temporally expected (on time) or unexpectedly early or late time points relative to extrapolation of the context rhythm. Consistent with involvement of attentional entrainment in perceived duration, duration judgements about the oddball were least distorted when the oddball occurred on time with respect to the entrained rhythm, whereas durations of early and late oddballs were perceived to be shorter and longer, respectively. This pattern of results was independent of the absolute time interval preceding the oddball. Moreover, as expected, an irregularly timed sequence context weakened observed differences between oddballs with on-time and late onsets. Combined with other recent work on the role of temporal preparation in duration distortions, the present findings allot at least a portion of the oddball effect to increased attention to events that are more expected, rather than on their unexpected nature per se.},

These mechanisms can arise from synaptic plasticity, synaptic noise, and somatic and dendritic conductances. This tool kit of nonlinear mechanisms confers considerable computational power on both morphologically simple and more complex neurons, enabling them to perform a range of arithmetic operations on signals encoded ina variety of different ways.},

abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals. Individual SCN neurons in dispersed culture can generate independent circadian oscillations of clock gene expression and neuronal firing. However, SCN rhythmicity depends on sufficient membrane depolarization and levels of intracellular calcium and cAMP. In the intact SCN, cellular oscillations are synchronized and reinforced by rhythmic synaptic input from other cells, resulting in a reproducible topographic pattern of distinct phases and amplitudes specified by SCN circuit organization. The SCN network synchronizes its component cellular oscillators, reinforces their oscillations, responds to light input by altering their phase distribution, increases their robustness to genetic perturbations, and enhances their precision. Thus, even though individual SCN neurons can be cell-autonomous circadian oscillators, neuronal network properties are integral to normal function of the SCN.},

The present theme issue provides a survey of theoretical, review and research work cutting across the biological and the cognitive sciences, focusing on various species of fishes, birds and primates (including humans) and emphasizing an integrative approach to the study of lateralization encompassing neural, behavioural, cognitive, developmental and environmental aspects.},

By reviewing and combining results from data-driven and theory-driven studies, we attempt to provide an integrated systems view of cerebellar neuromodulation. First, we review the short- and long-term effects of neuromodulators on the cerebellar circuitry. Second, we review recent theories of the cerebellum and show that a number of modulatory signals are needed for powerful cerebellar learning and control. Finally, we attempt to match each theoretically derived modulatory signal with a specific neuromodulator. In particular, we propose that serotonin controls the 'responsibility' of each cerebellar unit (or microcomplex) in cerebellar learning and control; norepinephrine gates unsupervised learning in the cerebellar cortex; dopamine enhances goal-oriented cerebellar learning; and, finally, acetylcholine controls the speed of supervised learning in Purkinje cells.},

abstract = {Aberrant $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated inhibition in cortico-thalamic networks remains an attractive mechanism for typical absence seizure genesis. Using the whole-cell patch clamp technique we examined 'phasic' and 'tonic' GABA(A) inhibition in thalamocortical neurons of somatosensory (ventrobasal, VB) thalamus, nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) neurons, and layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory (barrel) cortex of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) knock-out (SSADH(-/-)) mice that replicate human SSADH deficiency and exhibit typical absence seizures. We found increased sIPSC frequency in both VB and NRT neurons and larger sIPSC amplitude in VB neurons of SSADH(-/-) mice compared to wild-type animals, demonstrating an increase in total phasic inhibition in thalamus of SSADH(-/-) mice. mIPSCs in both VB and NRT neurons were no different between genotypes, although there remained a trend toward more events in SSADH(-/-) mice. In cortical layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons, sIPSCs were fewer but larger in SSADH(-/-) mice, a feature retained by mIPSCs. Tonic currents were larger in both thalamocortical neurons and layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons from SSADH(-/-) mice compared to WTs. These data show that enhanced, rather than compromised, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition occurs in cortico-thalamic networks of SSADH(-/-) mice. In agreement with previous studies, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory gain-of-function may be a common feature in models of typical absence seizures, and could be of pathological importance in patients with SSADH deficiency.},

Attention to time or color stimulus attributes was modulated parametrically in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Linear increases in task performance were accompanied by corresponding increases in brain activity. Increasing attention to time selectively increased activity in a corticostriatal network, including pre-supplementary motor area and right frontal operculum. Increasing attention to color selectively increased activity in area V4. By identifying areas whose activity was specifically modulated by attention to time, we have defined the core neuroanatomical substrates of timing behavior.},

Goals were that these measures (a) could be derived from commonly used neuropsychological tests, (b) would have linear measurement properties, and (c) would be psychometrically matched. Scale development was based on a sample of 400 older individuals with cognitive function ranging from normal to demented. Scales were reasonably matched with linear measurement over an ability range relevant to many important clinical applications. Cognitively normal, mild impairment, and dementia participant groups differed on baseline measures and rate of decline.

By enabling scientists to address these questions at the levels of genes, neurons, circuitry and behavior,the zebrafish model system provides a route to resolve the complexity of brain lateralization. In this review, we present the progress made towards characterizing the nature of the gene networks and the sequence of morphogenetic events involved in the asymmetric development of zebrafish epithalamus. In an attempt to integrate the recent extensive knowledge into a working model and to identify the future challenges,we discuss how insights gained at a cellular/developmental level can be linked to the data obtained at a molecular/genetic level. Finally, we present some evolutionary thoughts and discuss how significant discoveries made in zebrafish should provide entry points to better understand the evolutionary origins of brain lateralization.},

@article{Neuringer2002,
abstract = {Although responses are sometimes easy to predict, at other times responding seems highly variable, unpredictable, or even random. The inability to predict is generally attributed to ignorance of controlling variables, but this article is a review of research showing that the highest levels of behavioral variability may result from identifiable reinforcers contingent on such variability. That is, variability is an operant. Discriminative stimuli and reinforcers control it, resulting in low or high variability, depending on the contingencies. Schedule-of-reinforcement effects are orderly, and choosing to vary or repeat is lawfully governed by relative reinforcement frequencies. The operant nature of variability has important implications. For example, learning, exploring, creating, and problem solving may partly depend on it. Abnormal levels of variability, including those found in psychopathologies such as autism, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, may be modified through reinforcement. Operant variability may also help to explain some of the unique attributes of voluntary action.},

abstract = {Philosophers have pointed out that there is a close relation between the esthetics of art and the beauty of natural scenes. Supporting this similarity at the experimental level, we have recently shown that visual art and natural scenes share fractal-like, scale-invariant statistical properties. Moreover, evidence from neurophysiological experiments shows that the visual system uses an efficient (sparse) code to process optimally the statistical properties of natural stimuli. In the present work, a hypothetical model of esthetic perception is described that combines both lines of evidence. Specifically, it is proposed that an artist creates a work of art so that it induces a specific resonant state in the visual system. This resonant state is thought to be based on the adaptation of the visual system to natural scenes. The proposed model is universal and predicts that all human beings share the same general concept of esthetic judgment. The model implies that esthetic perception, like the coding of natural stimuli, depends on stimulus form rather than content, depends on higher-order statistics of the stimuli, and is non-intuitive to cognitive introspection. The model accommodates the central tenet of neuroesthetic theory that esthetic perception reflects fundamental functional properties of the nervous system.},

abstract = {Behavioral research has yielded conflicting results regarding the architecture of short-term memory (STM). Whereas a consensus has emerged that within STM a single chunk within the focus of attention (FA) has a privileged status, it is unclear whether further distinctions exist. One proposal is that outside of FA, memory is all of one sort with a continuous progression from STM to long-term memory (LTM). On the other hand, sharp performance drop-offs when STM is loaded with more than 4±1 items suggest distinctions between STM and LTM. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to adjudicate between these theories. A neural triple dissociation provided evidence for a 3-state model of memory. Critically, prefrontal cortex was selectively enhanced to retrieval from activated portions of LTM whereas the hippocampus was associated with retrieval of items within putative 4±1 capacity limits. We hypothesize that the associative properties of the hippocampus serve to inter-relate information actively maintained in STM which not only promotes strong STM, but also lays the foundations for subsequent LTM. By contrast, information not actively maintained in mind requires top-down retrieval processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex. These data provide key insights into the architecture of STM and its relationship to LTM.},

This article reviews evidence suggesting that these two neuronal types are generated in distinct proliferative zones. Pyramidal cells are derived from the neuroepithelium in the cortical ventricular zone, and use the processes of radial glia in order to migrate and take their positions in the cortex in an 'inside-out' sequence. Relatively few nonpyramidal cells are generated in the cortical neuroepithelium: the majority is derived from the ganglionic eminence of the ventral telencephalon. These nonpyramidal neurones use tangential migratory paths to reach the cortex, probably travelling along axonal bundles of the developing corticofugal fibre system.},

It is believed that correlations are a consequence of shared inputs between nearby neurons and could severely constrain information decoding. Here we show theoretically that recurrent neural networks can generate an asynchronous state characterized by arbitrarily low mean spiking correlations despite substantial amounts of shared input. In this state, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations accurately track each other, generating negative correlations in synaptic currents which cancel the effect of shared input. Near-zero mean correlations were seen experimentally in recordings from rodent neocortex in vivo. Our results suggest a reexamination of the sources underlying observed correlations and their functional consequences for information processing.},

abstract = {Aldolase C (zebrin) expression in Purkinje cells reveals stripe-shaped compartments in the cerebellar cortex. However, it is not clear how these compartments are related to cerebellar functional localization. Therefore, we identified olivocerebellar projections to aldolase C compartments by labeling climbing fibers with biotinylated dextran injected into various small areas within the inferior olive in rats. Specific rostral and caudal aldolase C compartments were linked in an orderly manner by common olivocerebellar projection across the rostrocaudal boundary on lobule VIc-crus Ib. Based on the localization of the olivary origins of projection to similar compartments, the compartments and olivocerebellar projections could be sorted into five groups: group I, positive compartments extending from the posterior lobe to the anterior lobe innervated by the principal olive and some neighboring areas; group II, positive compartments localized within the posterior lobe innervated by several medial subnuclei; group III, vermal and central negative compartments innervated by the centrocaudal medial accessory olive; group IV, negative and lightly positive compartments in the hemisphere and the rostral and caudal pars intermedia innervated by the dorsal accessory olive and some neighboring areas; group V, the flocculus and nodulus. The olivocerebellar topography within each group was simple and suggests an "orientation axis" within the concerned parts of the inferior olive. Furthermore, parts of the inferior olive in each group receive specific afferent inputs, indicating a close relationship between aldolase C compartments and functional localization. Thus, the five-group scheme we propose here may integrate the molecular, topographic, and functional organization of the cerebellum.},

We hypothesized that by impairing phonemic parsing abnormal low-gamma sampling could yield phonemic representations of unusual format and disrupt phonological processing and verbal memory. Using magnetoencephalography and behavioral tests, we show in dyslexic subjects a reduced left-hemisphere bias for phonemic processing, reflected in less entrainment to ≈30 Hz acoustic modulations in left auditory cortex. This deficit correlates with measures of phonological processing and rapid naming. We further observed enhanced cortical entrainment at rates beyond 40 Hz in dyslexics and show that this particularity is associated with a verbal memory deficit. These data suggest that a single auditory anomaly, i.e., phonemic oversampling in left auditory cortex, accounts for three main facets of the linguistic deficit in dyslexia.},

When one of these rhythms is the synchronization target and the other serves as a distracter at various temporal offsets, strong auditory dominance is observed. However, it has recently been shown that visuomotor synchronization improves substantially with moving stimuli such as a continuously bouncing ball. The present study pitted a bouncing ball against an auditory metronome in a target-distracter synchronization paradigm, with the participants being auditory experts (musicians) and visual experts (video gamers and ball players). Synchronization was still less variable with auditory than with visual target stimuli in both groups. For musicians, auditory stimuli tended to be more distracting than visual stimuli, whereas the opposite was the case for the visual experts. Overall, there was no main effect of distracter modality. Thus, a distracting spatiotemporal visual rhythm can be as effective as a distracting auditory rhythm in its capacity to perturb synchronous movement, but its effectiveness also depends on modality-specific expertise.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of normal sexual dimorphisms of cortical and subcortical brain regions, using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, in a community sample of 48 normal adults. The men and women were similar in age, education, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, general intelligence and handedness. Forty-five brain regions were assessed based on T(1)-weighted three-dimensional images acquired from a 1.5 T magnet. Sexual dimorphisms of adult brain volumes were more evident in the cortex, with women having larger volumes, relative to cerebrum size, particularly in frontal and medial paralimbic cortices. Men had larger volumes, relative to cerebrum size, in frontomedial cortex, the amygdala and hypothalamus. A permutation test showed that, compared to other brain areas assessed in this study, there was greater sexual dimorphism among brain areas that are homologous with those identified in animal studies showing greater levels of sex steroid receptors during critical periods of brain development. These findings have implications for developmental studies that would directly test hypotheses about mechanisms relating sex steroid hormones to sexual dimorphisms in humans.},

abstract = {In most species, the capability of perceiving and using the passage of time in the seconds-to-minutes range (interval timing) is not only accurate but also scalar: errors in time estimation are linearly related to the estimated duration. The ubiquity of scalar timing extends over behavioral, lesion, and pharmacological manipulations. For example, in mammals, dopaminergic drugs induce an immediate, scalar change in the perceived time (clock pattern), whereas cholinergic drugs induce a gradual, scalar change in perceived time (memory pattern). How do these properties emerge from unreliable, noisy neurons firing in the milliseconds range? Neurobiological information relative to the brain circuits involved in interval timing provide support for an striatal beat frequency (SBF) model, in which time is coded by the coincidental activation of striatal spiny neurons by cortical neural oscillators. While biologically plausible, the impracticality of perfect oscillators, or their lack thereof, questions this mechanism in a brain with noisy neurons. We explored the computational mechanisms required for the clock and memory patterns in an SBF model with biophysically realistic and noisy Morris-Lecar neurons (SBF-ML). Under the assumption that dopaminergic drugs modulate the firing frequency of cortical oscillators, and that cholinergic drugs modulate the memory representation of the criterion time, we show that our SBF-ML model can reproduce the pharmacological clock and memory patterns observed in the literature. Numerical results also indicate that parameter variability (noise) - which is ubiquitous in the form of small fluctuations in the intrinsic frequencies of neural oscillators within and between trials, and in the errors in recording/retrieving stored information related to criterion time - seems to be critical for the time-scale invariance of the clock and memory patterns.},

abstract = {Temporal regularity allows predicting the temporal locus of future information thereby potentially facilitating cognitive processing. We applied event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate how temporal regularity impacts pre-attentive and attentive processing of deviance in the auditory modality. Participants listened to sequences of sinusoidal tones differing exclusively in pitch. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) in these sequences was manipulated to convey either isochronous or random temporal structure. In the pre-attentive session, deviance processing was unaffected by the regularity manipulation as evidenced in three event-related-potentials (ERPs): mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a, and reorienting negativity (RON). In the attentive session, the P3b was smaller for deviant tones embedded in irregular temporal structure, while the N2b component remained unaffected. These findings confirm that temporal regularity can reinforce cognitive mechanisms associated with the attentive processing of deviance. Furthermore, they provide evidence for the dynamic allocation of attention in time and dissociable pre-attentive and attention-dependent temporal processing mechanisms.},

Despite the foundational role of status in social cognition, we know little about how the brain constructs status from social interactions that display it. Although emerging cognitive neuroscience reveals that status judgments depend on the intraparietal sulcus, a brain region that supports the comparison of targets along a quantitative continuum, we present evidence that status judgments do not necessarily reduce to ranking targets along a quantitative continuum. The process of judging status also fits a social interdependence analysis. Consistent with third-party perceivers judging status by inferring whose goals are dictating the terms of the interaction and who is subordinating their desires to whom, status judgments were associated with increased recruitment of medial pFC and STS, brain regions implicated in mental state inference},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cortical auditory evoked potentials, including mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a to pure tones, harmonic complexes, and speech syllables, were examined across groups of trained musicians and nonmusicians. Because of the extensive formal and informal auditory training received by musicians throughout their lifespan, it was predicted that these electrophysiological indicators of preattentive pitch discrimination and involuntary attention change would distinguish musicians from nonmusicians and provide insight regarding the influence of auditory training and experience on central auditory function. DESIGN: A total of 102 (67 trained musicians, 35 nonmusicians) right-handed young women with normal hearing participated in three auditory stimulus conditions: pure tones (25 musicians/15 nonmusicians), harmonic tones (42 musicians/20 nonmusicians), and speech syllables (26 musicians/15 nonmusicians). Pure tone and harmonic tone stimuli were presented in multideviant oddball paradigms designed to elicit MMN and P3a. Each paradigm included one standard and two infrequently occurring deviants. For the pure tone condition, the standard pure tone was 1000 Hz, and the two deviant tones differed in frequency from the standard by either 1.5{\%} (1015 Hz) or 6{\%} (1060 Hz). The harmonic tone complexes were digitally created and contained a fundamental frequency (F0) and three harmonics. The amplitude of each harmonic was divided by its harmonic number to create a natural amplitude contour in the frequency spectrum. The standard tone was G4 (F0 = 392 Hz), and the two deviant tones differed in fundamental frequency from the standard by 1.5{\%} (F0 = 386 Hz) or 6{\%} (F0 = 370 Hz). The fundamental frequencies of the harmonic tones occur within the average female vocal range. The third condition to elicit MMN and P3a was designed for the presentation of speech syllables (/ba/ and /da/) and was structured as a traditional oddball paradigm (one standard/one infrequent deviant). Each speech stimulus was presented as a standard and a deviant in separate blocks. P1-N1-P2 was elicited before each oddball task by presenting each auditory stimulus alone in single blocks. All cortical auditory evoked potentials were recorded in a passive listening condition. RESULTS: Incidental findings revealed that musicians had longer P1 latencies for pure tones and smaller P1 amplitudes for harmonic tones than nonmusicians. There were no P1 group differences for speech stimuli. Musicians compared with nonmusicians had shorter MMN latencies for all deviances (harmonic tones, pure tones, and speech). Musicians had shorter P3a latencies to harmonic tones and speech but not to pure tones. MMN and P3a amplitude were modulated by deviant frequency but not by group membership. CONCLUSIONS: Formally trained musicians compared with nonmusicians showed more efficient neural detection of pure tones and harmonic tones; demonstrated superior auditory sensory-memory traces for acoustic features of pure tones, harmonic tones, and speech; and revealed enhanced sensitivity to acoustic changes of spectrally rich stimuli (i.e., harmonic tones and speech). Findings support a general influence of music training on central auditory function and illustrate experience-facilitated modulation of the auditory neural system.},

We discuss formal models developed to emulate, explain and predict phenomena involved in early auditory processing, pitch processing, grouping, source separation, and music structure computation. We cover generic computational architectures of attention, memory, and expectation that can be instantiated and tuned to deal with specific musical phenomena. Criteria for the evaluation of such models are presented and discussed. Thereby, we lay out the general framework that provides the basis for the discussion of domain-specific music models in Part II.},

abstract = {The lateral forebrain of zebra finches that comprises parts of the lateral nidopallium and parts of the lateral mesopallium is supposed to be involved in the storage and processing of visual information acquired by an early learning process called sexual imprinting. This information is later used to select an appropriate sexual partner for courtship behavior. Being involved in such a complicated behavioral task, the lateral nidopallium should be an integrative area receiving input from many other regions of the brain. Our experiments indeed show that the lateral nidopallium receives input from a variety of telencephalic regions including the primary and secondary areas of both visual pathways, the globus pallidus, the caudolateral nidopallium functionally comparable to the prefrontal cortex, the caudomedial nidopallium involved in song perception and storage of song-related memories, and some parts of the arcopallium. There are also a number of thalamic, mesencephalic, and brainstem efferents including the catecholaminergic locus coeruleus and the unspecific activating reticular formation. The spatial distribution of afferents suggests a compartmentalization of the lateral nidopallium into several subdivisions. Based on its connections, the lateral nidopallium should be considered as an area of higher order processing of visual information coming from the tectofugal and the thalamofugal visual pathways. Other sensory modalities and also motivational factors from a variety of brain areas are also integrated here. These findings support the idea of an involvement of the lateral nidopallium in imprinting and the control of courtship behavior. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Neural mechanisms underlying this process require a link between the neural memory trace and the premotor song circuitry, which drives singing. We now report that a premotor song nucleus responds more to the tutor song model than to every other stimulus examined, including the bird's own song (BOS). Neural tuning to the song model occurred only during waking and peaked during the template-matching period of development, when the vocal motor output is sculpted to match the tutor song. During the same developmental phase, the BOS was the most effective excitatory stimulus during sleep. The preference for BOS compared to tutor song inverted with sleep/wake state. Thus, song preference shifts with development and state.},

abstract = {Recordings of single neurons have yielded great insights into the way acoustic stimuli are represented in auditory cortex. However, any one neuron functions as part of a population whose combined activity underlies cortical information processing. Here we review some results obtained by recording simultaneously from auditory cortical populations and individual morphologically identified neurons, in urethane-anesthetized and unanesthetized passively listening rats. Auditory cortical populations produced structured activity patterns both in response to acoustic stimuli, and spontaneously without sensory input. Population spike time patterns were broadly conserved across multiple sensory stimuli and spontaneous events, exhibiting a generally conserved sequential organization lasting approximately 100 ms. Both spontaneous and evoked events exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, and densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. Laminar propagation differed however, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. In both unanesthetized and urethanized rats, global activity fluctuated between "desynchronized" state characterized by low amplitude, high-frequency local field potentials and a "synchronized" state of larger, lower-frequency waves. Computational studies suggested that responses could be predicted by a simple dynamical system model fitted to the spontaneous activity immediately preceding stimulus presentation. Fitting this model to the data yielded a nonlinear self-exciting system model in synchronized states and an approximately linear system in desynchronized states. We comment on the significance of these results for auditory cortical processing of acoustic and non-acoustic information.},

abstract = {The cerebellum has a uniform cellular structure and microcircuitry, but the size of its subdivisions varies greatly among vertebrates. This variability is a challenge to anatomists to attempt to relate size differences to differences in characteristic behaviour. Here we review the early work of Lodewijk Bolk on the mammalian cerebellum and relate his observations to unfolded maps of the rodent cerebella. We further take insights from the comparative anatomy of the bird cerebella and find that cerebellar enlargement in large brains is not a passive consequence of overall brain enlargement, but is related to specific behaviour. We speculate that for some rodents (e.g., squirrels), primates and some large-brained birds (crows, parrots and woodpeckers), specifically enlarged cerebella are associated with either the elaboration of forelimb control (squirrels and primates) or in the case of the birds with beak control. The elaboration of such motor behaviour combined with increased visual control could have helped to furnish manipulative skills in these animals. Finally, we review the connections of the mammalian cerebellum and show that several pieces of experimental evidence point to an important function of the cerebellum in sensory control of movement reflex adjustment, and motor learning.},

In the broadest terms, attempts to dissect memory can be broken down into four experimental disciplines: (1) identification of molecular components, (2) ex vivo and in vivo cellular analysis of neuronal function, (3) theoretical modeling approaches of neural systems, and (4) organismal-level behavioral analyses. Our objective here is to offer a conceptually unifying perspective and to discuss this perspective in relation to an experiment analysis of memory in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Evolutionary transformations are recorded by fossils with transitional morphologies, and are key to understanding the history of life. Reconstructing these transformations requires interpreting functional attributes of extinct forms by exploring how similar features function in extant organisms. However, extinct-extant comparisons are often difficult, because extant adult forms frequently differ substantially from fossil material. Here, we illustrate how postnatal developmental transitions in extant birds can provide rich and novel insights into evolutionary transformations in theropod dinosaurs. Although juveniles have not been a focus of extinct-extant comparisons, developing juveniles in many groups transition through intermediate morphological, functional and behavioral stages that anatomically and conceptually parallel evolutionary transformations. Exploring developmental transitions may thus disclose observable, ecologically relevant answers to long puzzling evolutionary questions.},

abstract = {Cortical motion analysis continuously encodes image velocity but might also be used to predict future patterns of sensory input along the motion path. We asked whether this predictive aspect of motion is exploited by the human visual system. Targets can be more easily detected at the leading as compared to the trailing edge of motion [1], but this effect has been attributed to a nonspecific boost in contrast gain at the leading edge, linked to motion-induced shifts in spatial position [1-4]. Here we show that the detectability of a local sinusoidal target presented at the ends of a region containing motion is phase dependent at the leading edge, but not at the trailing edge. These two observations rule out a simple gain control mechanism that modulates contrast energy and passive filtering explanations, respectively. By manipulating the relative orientation of the moving pattern and target, we demonstrate that the resulting spatial variation in detection threshold along the edge closely resembles the superposition of sensory input and an internally generated predicted signal. These findings show that motion induces a forward prediction of spatial pattern that combines with the cortical representation of the future stimulus.},

abstract = {The selectivity of neurons in the zebra finch auditory forebrain for natural sounds was investigated systematically. The principal auditory forebrain area in songbirds consists of the tonotopically organized field L complex, which, by its location in the auditory processing stream, can be compared with the auditory cortex of mammals. We also recorded from a secondary auditory area, cHV. Field L and cHV are auditory processing stages that are presynaptic to the specialized song system nuclei where auditory neurons show an extremely selective response for the bird's own song, but weak response to almost any other sounds, including conspecific songs. In our study, we found that neurons in field L and cHV had stronger responses to conspecific song than to synthetic sounds that were designed to match the lower order acoustical properties of song, such as their overall power spectra and AM spectra. Such preferential responses to natural sounds cannot be explained by linear frequency tuning or simple nonlinear intensity tuning and requires linear or nonlinear spectro-temporal neuronal transfer functions tuned to the acoustical properties of song. The selectivity for conspecific songs in field L and cHV might reflect an intermediate auditory processing stage for vocalizations that then contributes to the generation of the very specific selectivity for the bird's own song seen in the postsynaptic song system.},

The AFP is homologous to cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops in mammals. The basal ganglia portion of this pathway, Area X, shares many features characteristic of the mammalian striatum and pallidum, including cell types and connectivity. The AFP also deviates from mammalian basal ganglia circuits in fundamental ways. In addition, the microcircuitry, role of neuromodulators, and function of Area X are still unclear. Elucidating the mechanisms by which both mammalian-like and unique features of the AFP contribute to vocal learning may help lead to a broad understanding of the sensorimotor functions of basal ganglia circuits.},

abstract = {In situ hybridization (ISH) is a sensitive technique for documenting the tissue distribution of mRNAs. Advanced nonradioactive ISH methods that are based on the use of digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes and chromogenic detection have better spatial resolution than emulsion autoradiography techniques and, when paired with high-resolution digital imaging, allow for large-scale profiling of gene expression at cellular resolution within a histological context. However, technical challenges restrict the number of genes that can be investigated in a small laboratory setting. This protocol describes an optimized, low-cost, small-footprint, high-throughput ISH procedure to detect gene expression patterns in 10-µm brain sections from zebra finches. It uses DIG-labeled riboprobes synthesized from cDNA templates available through the Songbird Neurogenomics Consortium. The method is compatible with high-resolution digital imaging; it produces images with low background and a resolution approaching that of immunohistochemical methods. Approximately 180 slides can be processed each week using this protocol, but it can be scaled to accommodate a broad range of tissues from which cryosections can be obtained.},

We searched for time representations in cortico-basal ganglia circuits by recording from thousands of neurons in the prefrontal cortex and striatum of macaque monkeys performing a routine visuomotor task. We found that a subset of neurons exhibited time-stamp encoding strikingly similar to that required by models of reinforcement-based learning: They responded with spike activity peaks that were distributed at different time delays after single task events. Moreover, the temporal evolution of the population activity allowed robust decoding of task time by perceptron models. We suggest that time information can emerge as a byproduct of event coding in cortico-basal ganglia circuits and can serve as a critical infrastructure for behavioral learning and performance.},

The spillover of synaptically released GABA can also activate extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs, and such tonic inhibition may also contribute to modulating network dynamics. In many neuronal cell types, tonic inhibition is mediated by delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs. We found that the frequency of in vitro cholinergically induced gamma oscillations in the mouse hippocampal CA3 region was increased by the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) on interneurons. The NMDAR-dependent increase of gamma oscillation frequency was counteracted by the tonic inhibition of the interneurons mediated by delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs. Recordings of synaptic currents during gamma activity revealed that NMDAR-mediated increases in oscillation frequency correlated with a progressive synchronization of phasic excitation and inhibition in the network. Thus, the balance between tonic excitation and tonic inhibition of interneurons may modulate gamma frequency by shaping interneuronal synchronization.},

Here we have examined whether these intriguing discrepancies between physical and perceived size can be explained by a visual process in which percepts are determined by the probability distribution of the possible real-world sources of retinal stimuli. To test this idea, we acquired a range image database of natural scenes that specified the location of every image point in 3-D space. By sampling the possible physical sources of various size contrast or assimilation stimuli in the database, we determined the probability distributions of the size of the target in the images generated by these sources. For each of the various stimuli tested, these probability distributions of target size in different contexts accurately predicted the perceptual effects reported in psychophysical studies. We conclude that size contrast and assimilation effects are a further manifestation of a fundamentally probabilistic process of visual perception.},

abstract = {Opsin gene expression in the R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila compound eye is highly coordinated. We have found that the R8 cell specific Rh5 and Rh6 opsins are expressed in non-overlapping sets of R8 cells, in a precise pairwise fashion with Rh3 and Rh4 in the R7 cells of individual ommatidia. Removal of the R7 cells in sevenless, boss or sina mutants, disrupts Rh5 expression and dramatically increases the number of Rh6-expressing R8 cells. This suggests that the expression of Rh5 may be induced by an Rh3-expressing R7 cell, whereas Rh6 expression is most likely a default state of the R8 cell. We found that the paired expression of opsin genes in the R7 and R8 cells occurs in a sevenless and boss independent manner. Furthermore, we found that the generation of both Rh3- and Rh4-expressing R7 cells can occur in the absence of an R8 cell. These results suggest that the specification of opsin expression in the R7 cells may occur autonomously, whereas the R7 photoreceptor cell may be responsible for regulating a binary developmental switch between induced and default cell-fates in the R8 cell.},

Here, we report a crosscultural study with participants from a native African population (Mafa) and Western participants, with both groups being naive to the music of the other respective culture. Experiment 1 investigated the ability to recognize three basic emotions (happy, sad, scared/fearful) expressed in Western music. Results show that the Mafas recognized happy, sad, and scared/fearful Western music excerpts above chance, indicating that the expression of these basic emotions in Western music can be recognized universally. Experiment 2 examined how a spectral manipulation of original, naturalistic music affects the perceived pleasantness of music in Western as well as in Mafa listeners. The spectral manipulation modified, among other factors, the sensory dissonance of the music. The data show that both groups preferred original Western music and also original Mafa music over their spectrally manipulated versions. It is likely that the sensory dissonance produced by the spectral manipulation was at least partly responsible for this effect, suggesting that consonance and permanent sensory dissonance universally influence the perceived pleasantness of music.},

abstract = {Zebrafish are an established and widely utilized developmental genetic model system, but limitations in developed behavioral assays have meant that their potential as a model in behavioral neuroscience has yet to be fully realized. Here, we describe the development of a novel operant behavioral assay to examine a variety of aspects of stimulus control in zebrafish using a 3 choice serial reaction time task (3 CSRTT). Fish were briefly exposed to three spatially distinct, but perceptually identical stimuli, presented in a random order after a fixed-time inter-trial interval (ITI). Entries to the correct response aperture either during the stimulus presentation, or within a brief limited hold period following presentation, were reinforced with illumination of the magazine light and delivery of a small food reward. Following training, premature responding was probed with a long-ITI session three times; once at baseline, once following a saline injection and once following an injection of a low dose of amphetamine (AMPH; 0.025. mg/kg). We predicted that if premature responding was related to impulsivity (as in rodents) it would be reduced following the AMPH injection. Results confirmed that zebrafish could learn to perform a complex operant task similar to tasks developed for rodents which are used to probe sustained attention and impulsivity, but the results from the AMPH trials were inconclusive. This study provides the foundations for development and further validation of this species as a model for some aspects of human attentional and impulse control disorders, such as substance abuse disorder. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Mazzoni2006,
abstract = {The relationship between implicit and explicit processes during motor learning, and for visuomotor adaptation in particular, is poorly understood. We set up a conflict between implicit and explicit processes by instructing subjects to counter a visuomotor rotation using a cognitive strategy in a pointing task. Specifically, they were told the exact nature of the directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45 degrees counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise target, 45 degrees away. Subjects were initially successful in completely negating the rotation with this strategy. Surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target. The cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target. Notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. These results indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by the motor planning system. This suggests that the motor system requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the expense of an opposing explicit task goal.},

abstract = {The responses of 20 young adult emmetropes with normal color vision were measured on a battery of visual performance tasks. Using previously documented tests of known reliability, we evaluated orientation discrimination, contrast sensitivity, wavelength sensitivity, vernier acuity, direction-of-motion detection, velocity discrimination, and complex form identification. Performance varied markedly between individuals, both on a given test and when the scores from all tests were combined to give an overall indication of visual performance. Moreover, individual performances on tests of contrast sensitivity, orientation discrimination, wavelength discrimination, and vernier acuity covaried, such that proficiency on one test predicted proficiency on the others. These results indicate a wide range of visual abilities among normal subjects and provide the basis for an overall index of visual proficiency that can be used to determine whether the surprisingly large and coordinated size differences of the components of the human visual system (Andrews, Halpern, {\&} Purves, 1997) are reflected in corresponding variations in visual performance.},

Although this invariance has been described in behavioral studies, the underlying neural mechanism is essentially unknown. Here we show a putative level-invariant representation of sounds by populations of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) that may provide a neural basis for the behavioral observations. Previous studies reported that pure-tone frequency tuning of most A1 neurons widens with increasing sound level. In sharp contrast, we found that a large proportion of neurons in A1 of awake marmosets were narrowly and separably tuned to both frequency and sound level. Tuning characteristics and firing rates of the neural population were preserved across all tested sound levels. These response properties lead to a level-invariant representation of sounds over the population of A1 neurons. Such a representation is an important step for robust feature recognition in natural environments.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations, repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar operations to different problems. A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

@article{Shinozaki1997,
abstract = {Land plants suffer from dehydration or water stress not only under drought and high-salt-concentration conditions but also under low-temperature conditions. They respond and adapt to water stress to survive these environmental stress conditions. Water stress induces various biochemical and physiological responses in plants. Under water-stress conditions plant cells lose water and decrease turgor pres- sure. The plant hormone ABA increases as a result of water stress, and ABA has important roles in the tolerance of plants to drought, high salinity, and cold. A number of genes that respond to drought, salt, and cold stress at the transcriptional level have recently been described (for re- view, see Ingram and Bartels, 1996; Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 1996; Bray, 1997). The mRNAs of water-stress-inducible genes decrease when the plants are released from stress conditions, which is consistent with evidence that shows that these genes respond to water stress or dehydration. The functions of some gene products have been predicted from sequence homology with known proteins and are thought to have a role in protecting the cells from water deficit (Ingram and Bartels, 1996; Bray, 1997). Expression patterns of dehydration-inducible genes are complex. Some genes respond to water stress very rapidly, whereas others are induced slowly after the accumulation of ABA. Most of the genes that respond to drought, salt, and cold stress are also induced by exogenous application of ABA (for review, see Shinozaki and Yamaguchi- Shinozaki, 1996; Bray et al., 1997). It appears that dehydra- tion triggers the production of ABA, which in turn induces various genes. Severa1 genes that are induced by water stress are not responsive to exogenous ABA treatment. These findings suggest the existence of both ABA- independent and ABA-dependent signal transduction cascades between the initial signal of drought or cold stress and the expression of specific genes (Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 1996; Bray et al., 1997). Promoter analysis of drought- and cold-inducible genes has identi- fied severa1 cis-acting elements that are involved in ABA- dependent and ABA-independent responses to conditions of water stress. Details of molecular mechanisms regulating responses of plant genes to water stress remain to be discovered, and there are many questions to be examined at the molecular level. These include the sensing mechanisms of water stress or osmotic stress, modulation of the stress signals to cellu- lar signals, transduction of the cellular signals to the nu- cleus, transcriptional control of stress-inducible genes, and the function and cooperation of stress-inducible genes al- lowing water-stress tolerance. This Update focuses on re- cent progress toward understanding the signal transduc- tion cascades leading to expression of water-stress- inducible genes. Possible sensors of osmotic stress in plants are discussed based on our knowledge of yeast and bacte- ria1 sensors. A glossary of terms is included to facilitate the reading. CLOSSARY},

However, emerging evidence shows that many forms of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity at different sites are induced conjunctively during procedural memory formation in the cerebellum. Here, we review the main forms of long-term plasticity in the cerebellar cortex that underlie motor learning. We propose that the different forms of plasticity in the granular layer and the molecular layer operate synergistically in a temporally and spatially distributed manner, so as to ultimately create optimal output for behaviour.},

Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia have highly conserved circuit architecture in vertebrates. The cerebellum has consistently been shown to be necessary for adaptation of eye and limb movements. The precise contribution of the basal ganglia to motor learning remains unclear but one consistent finding is that they are necessary for early acquisition of novel sequential actions. The primary motor cortex allows independent control of joints and construction of new movement synergies. We suggest that this capacity of the motor cortex implies that it is a necessary locus for motor skill learning, which we argue is the ability to execute selected actions with increasing speed and precision.},

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the cellular mechanisms of STDP at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and of the associated changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic integration. Beyond the basic asymmetric window, recent studies have also revealed several layers of complexity in STDP, including its dependence on dendritic location, the nonlinear integration of synaptic modification induced by complex spike trains, and the modulation of STDP by inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs. Finally, the functional consequences of STDP have been examined directly in an increasing number of neural circuits in vivo.},

abstract = {The effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) on glutamate-induced excitation of Purkinje cells were examined. Pulsatile iontophoretic applications of glutamate (1-25 nA) induced consistent increases in the spontaneous activity of Purkinje cells. When serotonin was applied continuously with currents that elicited minimum changes in the spontaneous rate, it inhibited or blocked glutamate-induced excitations significantly in most Purkinje cells. We also examined the effects of high currents of serotonin on spontaneous activity of Purkinje cells. High currents of serotonin induced 3 different effects: inhibitions, biphasic effects comprising transient inhibition followed by excitation, and excitations. Nonetheless, whether it inhibited or excited the activity of Purkinje cells, serotonin inhibited glutamate-induced excitations consistently. The effect of a putative 5-HT antagonist methysergide (UML) was also examined. Methysergide consistently attenuated or antagonized the inhibitory effects of serotonin on glutamate-induced excitations. This finding suggests strongly that inhibitory effects of 5-HT on glutamate excitations observed in the present study is the specific action of serotonin.},

abstract = {Converging evidence implicates the auditory forebrain regions caudal medial mesopallium (formerly cmHV) and caudal medial nidopallium in the perceptual processing of conspecific vocalizations in songbirds. Little is known however, about more specific processing within these regions especially during song-based perceptual behaviors. One hallmark of the caudal medial mesopallium and caudal medial nidopallium, areas analogous to mammalian secondary auditory cortical structures, is their robust expression of the immediate-early-gene zenk in response to conspecific songs. Using European starlings operantly trained to recognize the songs of individual conspecifics, we show that the levels and patterns of zenk protein expression in the caudal medial nidopallium and caudal medial mesopallium differ when song recognition demands are placed on the system. In the caudal medial mesopallium, expression is significantly elevated above basal levels during the recognition of familiar songs, the acquisition of novel associations for familiar songs, and the acquisition of novel song discriminations. In the caudal medial nidopallium, however, expression is significantly elevated above basal levels only during the acquisition of novel song discriminations. The results directly implicate the caudal medial nidopallium and caudal medial mesopallium in at least a portion of the auditory processes underlying vocal recognition. Moreover, the observed differences between these regions imply the functional localization (or at least the concentration) of different auditory processing mechanisms within the caudal medial nidopallium and the caudal medial mesopallium.},

Recent genetic approaches conferring single-cell resolution have enabled major advances in our understanding of the cellular and molecular strategies that orchestrate visual circuit assembly in Drosophila. Photoreceptor axon targeting relies on a sequence of interdependent developmental steps to achieve temporal coordination with the formation and maturation of partner neurons. Distinct targeting events depend on anterograde and autocrine signaling, neuron-glia interactions, axon tiling and the timely expression of homophilic cell surface molecules. These mediate local adhesive or repulsive interactions of photoreceptor axons with each other and with target neurons.},

@article{Paul2005,
abstract = {Contemporary researchers regard emotional states as multifaceted, comprising physiological, behavioural, cognitive and subjective components. Subjective, conscious experience of emotion can be inferred from linguistic report in humans, but is inaccessible to direct measurement in non-human animals. However, measurement of other components of emotion is possible, and a variety of methods exist for monitoring emotional processes in animals by measuring behavioural and physiological changes. These are important tools, but they have limitations including difficulties of interpretation and the likelihood that many may be sensitive indicators of emotional arousal but not valence - pleasantness/unpleasantness. Cognitive components of emotion are a largely unexplored source of information about animal emotions, despite the fact that cognition-emotion links have been extensively researched in human cognitive science indicating that cognitive processes - appraisals of stimuli, events and situations - play an important role in the generation of emotional states, and that emotional states influence cognitive functioning by inducing attentional, memory and judgement biases. Building on this research, it is possible to design non-linguistic cognitive measures of animal emotion that may be especially informative in offering new methods for assessing emotional valence (positive as well as negative), discriminating same-valenced emotion of different types, identifying phenotypes with a cognitive predisposition to develop affective disorders, and perhaps shedding light on the issue of conscious emotional experiences in animals. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We presented probe beats on seven positions within a test bar. Two bars of either a duple- or triple meter rhythm preceded probe beats. We hypothesised that sequential processing would lead to meter effects at the 1/3 and 1/2bar positions, whereas hierarchical processing would lead to context effects on the 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3bar positions. We found that metric contexts affected behavioural ratings. This effect was more pronounced for rhythmic experts. In addition, both the AEP P3a and P3b component could be identified. Though metric context affected the P3a amplitudes, group effects were less clear. We found that the AEP P3a component is sensitive to violation of temporal expectancies. In addition, behavioural data and P3a correlation coefficients (CCs) suggest that temporal patterns are processed sequentially in nonmusicians but are processed in a hierarchical way in rhythmic experts.},

abstract = {We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effect of two factors on the neural control of temporal sequence performance: the modality in which the rhythms had been trained, and the modality of the pacing stimuli preceding performance. The rhythms were trained 1-2 days before scanning. Each participant learned two rhythms: one was presented visually, the other auditorily. During fMRI, the rhythms were performed in blocks. In each block, four beats of a visual or auditory pacing metronome were followed by repetitive self-paced rhythm performance from memory. Data from the self-paced performance phase was analysed in a 2x2 factorial design, with the two factors Training Modality (auditory or visual) and Metronome Modality (auditory or visual), as well as with a conjunction analysis across all active conditions, to identify activations that were independent of both Training Modality and Metronome Modality. We found a significant main effect only for visual versus auditory Metronome Modality, in the left angular gyrus, due to a deactivation of this region after auditory pacing. The conjunction analysis revealed a set of brain areas that included dorsal auditory pathway areas (left temporo-parietal junction area and ventral premotor cortex), dorsal premotor cortex, the supplementary and presupplementary premotor areas, the cerebellum and the basal ganglia. We conclude that these regions are involved in controlling performance of well-learned rhythms, regardless of the modality in which the rhythms are trained and paced. This suggests that after extensive short-term training, all rhythms, even those that were both trained and paced in visual modality, had been transformed into auditory-motor representations. The deactivation of the angular cortex following auditory pacing may represent cross-modal auditory-visual inhibition.},

abstract = {A fundamental attribute of human hearing is the ability to extract a residue pitch from harmonic complex sounds such as those produced by musical instruments and the human voice. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie this processing are unclear, as are the locations of these mechanisms in the auditory pathway. The ability to extract a residue pitch corresponding to the fundamental frequency from individual harmonics, even when the fundamental component is absent, has been demonstrated separately for conventional pitches and for Huggins pitch (HP), a stimulus without monaural pitch information. HP is created by presenting the same wideband noise to both ears, except for a narrowband frequency region where the noise is decorrelated across the two ears. The present study investigated whether residue pitch can be derived by combining a component derived solely from binaural interaction (HP) with a spectral component for which no binaural processing is required. Fifteen listeners indicated which of two sequentially presented sounds was higher in pitch. Each sound consisted of two "harmonics," which independently could be either a spectral or a HP component. Component frequencies were chosen such that the relative pitch judgement revealed whether a residue pitch was heard or not. The results showed that listeners were equally likely to perceive a residue pitch when one component was dichotic and the other was spectral as when the components were both spectral or both dichotic. This suggests that there exists a single mechanism for the derivation of residue pitch from binaurally created components and from spectral components, and that this mechanism operates at or after the level of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (brainstem) or the inferior colliculus (midbrain), which receive inputs from the medial superior olive where temporal information from the two ears is first combined.},

abstract = {Marr-Albus adaptive filter models of the cerebellum have been applied successfully to a range of sensory and motor control problems. Here we analyze their properties when applied to classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response in rabbits. We consider a system-level model of eyeblink conditioning based on the anatomy of the eyeblink circuitry, comprising an adaptive filter model of the cerebellum, a comparator model of the inferior olive and a linear dynamic model of the nictitating membrane plant. To our knowledge, this is the first model that explicitly includes all these principal components, in particular the motor plant that is vital for shaping and timing the behavioral response. Model assumptions and parameters were systematically investigated to disambiguate basic computational capacities of the model from features requiring tuning of properties and parameter values. Without such tuning, the model robustly reproduced a range of behaviors related to sensory prediction, by displaying appropriate trial-level associative learning effects for both single and multiple stimuli, including blocking and conditioned inhibition. In contrast, successful reproduction of the real-time motor behavior depended on appropriate specification of the plant, cerebellum and comparator models. Although some of these properties appear consistent with the system biology, fundamental questions remain about how the biological parameters are chosen if the cerebellar microcircuit applies a common computation to many distinct behavioral tasks. It is possible that the response profiles in classical conditioning of the eyeblink depend upon operant contingencies that have previously prevailed, for example in naturally occurring avoidance movements.},

abstract = {Sensory abnormalities and weak central coherence (WCC), a processing bias for features and local information, are important characteristics associated with autism. This paper introduces a self-organizing map (SOM)-based computational model of sensory abnormalities in autism, and of a feedback system to compensate for them. Feedback relies on a measure of balance of coverage over four (sensory) domains. Different methods to compute this measure are discussed, as is the flexibility to configure the system using different control mechanisms. Statistically significant improvements throughout training are demonstrated for compensation of a simple (i.e., monotonically decreasing) hypersensitivity in one of the domains. Fine-tuning control parameters can lead to further gains, but a standard setup results in good performance. Significant improvements are also shown for complex hypersensitivities (i.e., increasing and decreasing through time) in two domains. Although naturally best suited to compensate hypersensitivities--stimuli filtering may mitigate neuron migration to a hypersensitive domain--the system is also shown to perform effectively when compensating hyposensitivities. With poor coverage balance in the model akin to poor global perception, WCC would be consistent with inadequate feedback, resulting in uncontrolled hyper- and/or hyposensitivities characteristic of autism, as seen in the topologies of the resulting SOMs.},

The molecular mechanisms involved in priming one neurite to become the axon, particularly those regulating the microtubule network, remain elusive. Here we report the identification of DOCK7, a member of the DOCK180-related protein superfamily, as a Rac GTPase activator that is asymmetrically distributed in unpolarized hippocampal neurons and selectively expressed in the axon. Knockdown of DOCK7 expression prevents axon formation, whereas overexpression induces formation of multiple axons. We further demonstrate that DOCK7 and Rac activation lead to phosphorylation and inactivation of the microtubule destabilizing protein stathmin/Op18 in the nascent axon and that this event is important for axon development. Our findings unveil a pathway linking the Rac activator DOCK7 to a microtubule regulatory protein and highlight the contribution of microtubule network regulation to axon development.},

abstract = {From an early age, musicians learn complex motor and auditory skills (e.g., the translation of visually perceived musical symbols into motor commands with simultaneous auditory monitoring of output), which they practice extensively from childhood throughout their entire careers. Using a voxel-by-voxel morphometric technique, we found gray matter volume differences in motor, auditory, and visual-spatial brain regions when comparing professional musicians (keyboard players) with a matched group of amateur musicians and non-musicians. Although some of these multiregional differences could be attributable to innate predisposition, we believe they may represent structural adaptations in response to long-term skill acquisition and the repetitive rehearsal of those skills. This hypothesis is supported by the strong association we found between structural differences, musician status, and practice intensity, as well as the wealth of supporting animal data showing structural changes in response to long-term motor training. However, only future experiments can determine the relative contribution of predisposition and practice.},

@article{Newsome2000,
abstract = {During development of the adult Drosophila visual system, axons of the eight photoreceptors in each ommatidium fasciculate together and project as a single bundle towards the optic lobes of the brain. Within the brain, individual photoreceptor axons from each bundle then seek specific targets in distinct layers of the optic lobes. The axons of photoreceptors R1-R6 terminate in the lamina, while R7 and R8 axons pass through the lamina to terminate in separate layers of the medulla. To identify genes required for photoreceptor axon guidance, including those with essential functions during early development, we have devised a strategy for the simple and efficient generation of genetic mosaics in which mutant photoreceptor axons innervate a predominantly wild-type brain. In a large-scale saturation mutagenesis performed using this system, we recovered new alleles of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP69D. PTP69D has previously been shown to function in the correct targeting of motor axons in the embryo and R1-R6 axons in the visual system. Here, we show that PTP69D is also required for correct targeting of R7 axons. Whereas mutant R1-R6 axons occasionally extend beyond their normal targets in the lamina, mutant R7 axons often fail to reach their targets in the medulla, stopping instead at the same level as the R8 axon. These targeting errors are difficult to reconcile with models in which PTP69D plays an instructive role in photoreceptor axon targeting, as previously proposed. Rather, we suggest that PTP69D plays a permissive role, perhaps reducing the adhesion of R1-R6 and R7 growth cones to the pioneer R8 axon so that they can respond independently to their specific targeting cues.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that stochasticism is important for generating cell type diversity. We have identified a novel stochastic fate choice as part of the mechanism by which Delta/Notch (Dl/N) signaling specifies R7 fate in the Drosophila eye. The equivalence of R1/R6/R7 precursors is normally broken by the activation of N, which specifies the R7 fate. The orphan nuclear hormone receptor Seven-up (Svp) is necessary and sufficient to direct R1/R6/R7 precursors to adopt the R1/R6 fate. A simple model, therefore, is that N represses Svp, which otherwise prevents adoption of the R7 fate. However, we have found that R1/R6s lacking svp stochastically adopt either the R7 or the R8 fate with equal likelihood. We show that N specifies the R7 fate by a novel branched pathway: N represses Svp expression, thereby exposing an underlying stochastic choice between the R7 and R8 fates, and then tips this choice towards the R7 fate.},

abstract = {Two facts about the hippocampus have been common currency among neuroscientists for several decades. First, lesions of the hippocampus in humans prevent the acquisition of new episodic memories; second, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is a prominent feature of hippocampal synapses. Given this background, the hypothesis that hippocampus-dependent memory is mediated, at least in part, by hippocampal synaptic plasticity has seemed as cogent in theory as it has been difficult to prove in practice. Here we argue that the recent development of transgenic molecular devices will encourage a shift from mechanistic investigations of synaptic plasticity in single neurons towards an analysis of how networks of neurons encode and represent memory, and we suggest ways in which this might be achieved. In the process, the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity is necessary and sufficient for information storage in the brain may finally be validated.},

abstract = {Two of the most striking properties of the cerebellum are its control in timing of motor operations and its ability to adapt behavior to new sensorimotor associations. Here, we propose a 'time-window matching' hypothesis for granular layer processing. Our hypothesis states that mossy fiber inputs to the granular layer are transformed into well-timed spike bursts by intrinsic granule cell processing, that feedforward Golgi cell inhibition sets a limit to the duration of such bursts and that these activities are spread over particular fields in the granular layer so as to generate ongoing time-windows for proper control of interacting motor domains. The role of synaptic plasticity would be that of fine-tuning pre-wired circuits favoring activation of specific granule cell groups in relation to particular time windows. This concept has wide implications for processing in the olivo-cerebellar system as a whole.},

The results suggest a duration of neuronal representation of at least 10 s.

abstract = {Although the neural underpinnings of music cognition have been widely studied in the last 5 years, relatively little is known about the neuroscience underlying emotional reactions that music induces in listeners. Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the NAc and the VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Responses in the NAc and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences.},

abstract = {With a worldwide incidence as high as 6.7{\%} of children, febrile seizures are one of the most common reasons for seeking pediatric care, but the mechanisms underlying generation of febrile seizures are poorly understood. Febrile seizures have been suspected to have a genetic basis, and recently, mutations in GABAA receptor and sodium channel genes have been identified that are associated with febrile seizures and generalized seizures with febrile seizures plus pedigrees. Pentameric GABAA receptors mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain and are composed of combinations of alpha(1-6), beta(1-3), and gamma(1-3) subunits. In alphabetagamma2 GABAA receptors, the gamma2 subunit is critical for receptor trafficking, clustering, and synaptic maintenance, and mutations in the gamma2 subunit have been monogenically associated with autosomal dominant transmission of febrile seizures. Here, we report that whereas trafficking of wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors was slightly temperature dependent, trafficking of mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing gamma2 subunit mutations [gamma2(R43Q), gamma2(K289M), and gamma2(Q351X)] associated with febrile seizures was highly temperature dependent. In contrast, trafficking of mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing an alpha1 subunit mutation [alpha1(A322D)] not associated with febrile seizures was not highly temperature dependent. Brief increases in temperature from 37 to 40 degrees C rapidly ({\textless}10 min) impaired trafficking and/or accelerated endocytosis of heterozygous mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing gamma2 subunit mutations associated with febrile seizures but not of wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors or heterozygous mutant alpha1(A322D)beta2gamma2 receptors, suggesting that febrile seizures may be produced by a temperature-induced dynamic reduction of susceptible mutant surface GABAA receptors in response to fever.},

abstract = {A key discovery that has emerged from studies of the vocal system in songbirds is that neurons in these regions respond preferentially to playback of the bird's own song (BOS). This BOS selectivity is not a general property of neurons in primary and secondary auditory forebrain regions, field L and caudolateral mesopallium (CLM). Moreover, anatomical studies have been unable to conclusively define a direct projection from field L and/or CLM to HVC, a central structure for integrating sensory and motor information in the vocal system. To examine the communication between these regions, we used simultaneous dual-electrode recording in anesthetized male zebra finches and cross-correlation analysis to estimate the functional connectivity between auditory areas, field L and CLM, and HVC. We found that {\textgreater}or=18{\%} of neurons in field L and 33{\%} of neurons in CLM are functionally connected to HVC, most with auditory forebrain leading-HVC latencies ranging from 0.5 to 15 ms. These results indicate that field L and CLM communicate extensively with HVC through both direct and indirect anatomical connections. To further explore the role of the auditory forebrain cells that are functionally connected with HVC, we assessed their responsiveness and selectivity for a variety of natural and synthetic auditory stimuli. We found that field L and CLM neurons that are functionally connected to HVC exhibit generic auditory forebrain properties including the lack of BOS selectivity. This finding puts further constraints on the neural architecture and the nature of the nonlinearity that leads to BOS-selective auditory responses in the vocal control nuclei.},

People who knew the patients well (relatives or carers) completed a questionnaire about the patient's dysexecutive problems in everyday life, and this paper reports the extent to which the tests predicted the patients' everyday life problems. All of the tests were significantly predictive of at least some of the behavioral and cognitive deficits reported by patients' carers. However, factor analysis of the patients' dysexecutive symptoms suggested a fractionation of the dysexecutive syndrome, with neuropsychological tests loading differentially on 3 underlying cognitive factors (Inhibition, Intentionality, and Executive Memory), supporting the conclusions that different tests measure different cognitive processes, and that there may be limits to the fractionation of the executive system.},

Hence, cognitive involvement (typically thought of as expectancy) is assumed for most instances of classical and operant conditioning, with current theoretical differences concerning the level of cognition that is involved (e.g., simple association vs. rule learning), rather than its presence. Nevertheless, many psychologists not in the mainstream of learning theory continue to think of cognitive and conditioning theories as rival families of hypotheses. In this article, the data pertaining to the role of higher-order cognition in conditioning is reviewed, and a theoretical synthesis is proposed that provides a role for both automatic and cognitively mediated processes.},

abstract = {Traditionally time perception has been considered the product of a central, generic, cognitive mechanism. However, evidence is emerging for a distributive system with modality-specific sensory components (Morrone et al., 2005; Johnston et al., 2006). Here we show that fast contrast adaptation, which can be observed in the retina, induces a change in apparent duration. The perceived duration of a subsecond interval containing a 50{\%} luminance contrast drifting pattern is compressed when it follows a high (90{\%}) as compared to a low (10{\%}) contrast interval. The duration effect cannot be attributed to changes in latency at onset relative to offset, can be dissociated from the effect of contrast context on apparent speed or apparent contrast per se and it occurs in a retinocentric frame of reference. The temporal compression is limited to high drift temporal frequencies (≥10 Hz) and is not observed for equiluminant chromatic stimuli. This pattern of results indicates a major role for the magnocellular pathway in the neural encoding and representation of visual time.},

abstract = {Several algorithms have been proposed to characterize the spectro-temporal tuning properties of auditory neurons during the presentation of natural stimuli. Algorithms designed to work at realistic signal-to-noise levels must make some prior assumptions about tuning in order to produce accurate fits, and these priors can introduce bias into estimates of tuning. We compare a new, computationally efficient algorithm for estimating tuning properties, boosting, to a more commonly used algorithm, normalized reverse correlation. These algorithms employ the same functional model and cost function, differing only in their priors. We use both algorithms to estimate spectro-temporal tuning properties of neurons in primary auditory cortex during the presentation of continuous human speech. Models estimated using either algorithm, have similar predictive power, although fits by boosting are slightly more accurate. More strikingly, neurons characterized with boosting appear tuned to narrower spectral bandwidths and higher temporal modulation rates than when characterized with normalized reverse correlation. These differences have little impact on responses to speech, which is spectrally broadband and modulated at low rates. However, we find that models estimated by boosting also predict responses to non-speech stimuli more accurately. These findings highlight the crucial role of priors in characterizing neuronal response properties with natural stimuli.},

This observation supports the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}vocal learning hypothesis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} that suggests rhythmic entrainment to be a by-product of the vocal learning mechanisms that are shared by several bird and mammal species, including humans, but that are only weakly developed, or missing entirely, in nonhuman primates. To test this hypothesis we measured auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in two rhesus monkeys ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Macaca mulatta{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), probing a well-documented component in humans, the mismatch negativity (MMN) to study rhythmic expectation. We demonstrate for the first time in rhesus monkeys that, in response to infrequent deviants in pitch that were presented in a continuous sound stream using an oddball paradigm, a comparable ERP component can be detected with negative deflections in early latencies (Experiment 1). Subsequently we tested whether rhesus monkeys can detect gaps (omissions at random positions in the sound stream; Experiment 2) and, using more complex stimuli, also the beat (omissions at the first position of a musical unit, i.e. the ‘downbeat'; Experiment 3). In contrast to what has been shown in human adults and newborns (using identical stimuli and experimental paradigm), the results suggest that rhesus monkeys are not able to detect the beat in music. These findings are in support of the hypothesis that {\textless}italic{\textgreater}beat induction{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (the cognitive mechanism that supports the perception of a regular pulse from a varying rhythm) is species-specific and absent in nonhuman primates. In addition, the findings support the auditory timing {\textless}italic{\textgreater}dissociation hypothesis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, with rhesus monkeys being sensitive to rhythmic grouping (detecting the start of a rhythmic group), but not to the induced beat (detecting a regularity from a varying rhythm).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {To judge causality, organisms must determine the temporal order of their actions and sensations. However, this judgment may be confounded by changing delays in sensory pathways, suggesting the need for dynamic temporal recalibration. To test for such a mechanism, we artificially injected a fixed delay between participants' actions (keypresses) and subsequent sensations (flashes). After participants adapted to this delay, flashes at unexpectedly short delays after the keypress were often perceived as occurring before the keypress, demonstrating a recalibration of motor-sensory temporal order judgments. When participants experienced illusory reversals, fMRI BOLD signals increased in anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal cortex (ACC/MFC), a brain region previously implicated in conflict monitoring. This illusion-specific activation suggests that the brain maintains not only a recalibrated representation of timing, but also a less-plastic representation against which to compare it.},

Surprisingly, songbirds seem to lack this capacity, although they can learn to recognize human melodies and use complex acoustic sequences for communication. Decades of research have led to the widespread belief that songbirds, unlike humans, are strongly biased to use absolute pitch (AP) in melody recognition. This work relies almost exclusively on acoustically simple stimuli that may belie sensitivities to more complex spectral features. Here, we investigate melody recognition in a species of songbird, the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), using tone sequences that vary in both pitch and timbre. We find that small manipulations altering either pitch or timbre independently can drive melody recognition to chance, suggesting that both percepts are poor descriptors of the perceptual cues used by birds for this task. Instead we show that melody recognition can generalize even in the absence of pitch, as long as the spectral shapes of the constituent tones are preserved. These results challenge conventional views regarding the use of pitch cues in nonhuman auditory sequence recognition.},

abstract = {Male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) begin to sing around 45 days posthatch (d45) and tune their songs to match learned templates. Females never develop song, but they use male conspecific vocalizations for mate choice. While auditory perception is critical for both sexes, the responses of the immediate early genes (IEGs) ZENK and FOS differ in auditory brain areas of d30 males and females. The present study examined expression of these IEGs in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), caudomedial mesopallium (CMM; formerly cHV), and the hippocampus (HP) in both sexes at d45 in response to conspecific, heterospecific, or no songs. Overall, zebra finch song presentations resulted in the highest density of ZENK and FOS cells in each region analyzed, but expression varied across brain areas. Contrary to d30 birds, the IEG response patterns did not differ between the sexes. ZENK-immunoreactivity was significantly increased following exposure to conspecific songs compared to no songs, and zebra finch song presentations produced more FOS-immunoreactive nuclei than both heterospecific and no songs. While the pattern was consistent, significant effects of stimulus type were seen only in the NCM when the brain regions were analyzed separately. Furthermore, levels of FOS- and ZENK-immunoreactive neurons were higher in the lateral than medial NCM in both sexes. Along with previous work from our lab and others, these data suggest that at d45 neuronal responses within perceptual regions are still maturing on some levels, but IEG expression has acquired a number of adult characteristics.},

abstract = {GABAergic inhibition plays a central role in the control of pyramidal cell ensemble activities; thus, any signaling mechanism that regulates inhibition is able to fine-tune network patterns. Here, we provide evidence that the retrograde nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP cascade triggered by NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation plays a role in the control of hippocampal GABAergic transmission in mice. GABAergic synapses express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) postsynaptically and NO receptors (NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase) in the presynaptic terminals. We hypothesized that--similar to glutamatergic synapses--the Ca(2+) transients required to activate nNOS were provided by NMDA receptor activation. Indeed, administration of 5 $\mu$m NMDA induced a robust nNOS-dependent cGMP production in GABAergic terminals, selectively in the CA1 and CA3c areas. Furthermore, using preembedding, postembedding, and SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling, we provided quantitative immunocytochemical evidence that NMDAR subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B were present in most somatic GABAergic synapses postsynaptically. These data indicate that NMDARs can modulate hippocampal GABAergic inhibition via NO-cGMP signaling in an activity-dependent manner and that this effect is subregion specific in the mouse hippocampus.},

Our findings clearly indicate higher temporal sensitivity in the auditory than in the visual domain irrespective of type of timing task. To further evaluate whether there is evidence for a common modality-independent timing mechanism or for multiple modality-specific mechanisms, we used structural equation modeling to test three different theoretical models. Neither a single modality-independent timing mechanism, nor two independent modality-specific timing mechanisms fitted the empirical data. Rather, the data are well described by a hierarchical model with modality-specific visual and auditory temporal processing at a first level and a modality-independent processing system at a second level of the hierarchy.},

abstract = {The tendency to move in rhythmic synchrony with a musical beat (e.g., via head bobbing, foot tapping, or dance) is a human universal [1] yet is not commonly observed in other species [2]. Does this ability reflect a brain specialization for music cognition, or does it build on neural circuitry that ordinarily serves other functions? According to the "vocal learning and rhythmic synchronization" hypothesis [3], entrainment to a musical beat relies on the neural circuitry for complex vocal learning, an ability that requires a tight link between auditory and motor circuits in the brain [4, 5]. This hypothesis predicts that only vocal learning species (such as humans and some birds, cetaceans, and pinnipeds, but not nonhuman primates) are capable of synchronizing movements to a musical beat. Here we report experimental evidence for synchronization to a beat in a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita eleonora). By manipulating the tempo of a musical excerpt across a wide range, we show that the animal spontaneously adjusts the tempo of its rhythmic movements to stay synchronized with the beat. These findings indicate that synchronization to a musical beat is not uniquely human and suggest that animal models can provide insights into the neurobiology and evolution of human music [6].},

abstract = {Distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar individuals is an important task that shapes the expression of social behavior. As such, identifying the neural populations involved in processing and learning the sensory attributes of individuals is important for understanding mechanisms of behavior. Catecholamine-synthesizing neurons have been implicated in sensory processing, but relatively little is known about their contribution to auditory learning and processing across various vertebrate taxa. Here we investigated the extent to which immediate early gene expression in catecholaminergic circuitry reflects information about the familiarity of social signals and predicts immediate early gene expression in sensory processing areas in songbirds. We found that male zebra finches readily learned to differentiate between familiar and unfamiliar acoustic signals (‘songs') and that playback of familiar songs led to fewer catecholaminergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (but not in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, or periaqueductal gray) expressing the immediate early gene, EGR-1, than playback of unfamiliar songs. The pattern of EGR-1 expression in the locus coeruleus was similar to that observed in two auditory processing areas implicated in auditory learning and memory, namely the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and the caudal medial mesopallium (CMM), suggesting a contribution of catecholamines to sensory processing. Consistent with this, the pattern of catecholaminergic innervation onto auditory neurons co-varied with the degree to which song playback affected the relative intensity of EGR-1 expression. Together, our data support the contention that catecholamines like norepinephrine contribute to social recognition and the processing of social information.},

Because of the known role of glycolysis in biosynthesis, we tested whether learning-induced synaptic plasticity would lead to regionally appropriate, learning-dependent changes in AG. Functional MRI (fMRI) before, during, and after performance of a visual–motor adaptation task demon-strated that left Brodmann area 44 (BA44) played a key role in adap-tation, with learning-related changes to activity during the task and altered resting-state, functional connectivity after the task. PET scans before and after task performance indicated a sustained increase in AG in left BA 44 accompanied by decreased oxygen consumption. Inter-subject variability in behavioral adaptation rate correlated strongly with changes in AG in this region, as well as functional connectivity, which is consistent with a role for AG in synaptic plasticity. aerobic glycolysis | long-term potentiation | learning | long-term depression | PET},

abstract = {We review lesion and neuroimaging evidence on the role of the hippocampus, and other structures, in retention and retrieval of recent and remote memories. We examine episodic, semantic and spatial memory, and show that important distinctions exist among different types of these memories and the structures that mediate them. We argue that retention and retrieval of detailed, vivid autobiographical memories depend on the hippocampal system no matter how long ago they were acquired. Semantic memories, on the other hand, benefit from hippocampal contribution for some time before they can be retrieved independently of the hippocampus. Even semantic memories, however, can have episodic elements associated with them that continue to depend on the hippocampus. Likewise, we distinguish between experientially detailed spatial memories (akin to episodic memory) and more schematic memories (akin to semantic memory) that are sufficient for navigation but not for re-experiencing the environment in which they were acquired. Like their episodic and semantic counterparts, the former type of spatial memory is dependent on the hippocampus no matter how long ago it was acquired, whereas the latter can survive independently of the hippocampus and is represented in extra-hippocampal structures. In short, the evidence reviewed suggests strongly that the function of the hippocampus (and possibly that of related limbic structures) is to help encode, retain, and retrieve experiences, no matter how long ago the events comprising the experience occurred, and no matter whether the memories are episodic or spatial. We conclude that the evidence favours a multiple trace theory (MTT) of memory over two other models: (1) traditional consolidation models which posit that the hippocampus is a time-limited memory structure for all forms of memory; and (2) versions of cognitive map theory which posit that the hippocampus is needed for representing all forms of allocentric space in memory.},

abstract = {Perception of temporal patterns is critical for speech, movement, and music. In the auditory domain, perception of a regular pulse, or beat, within a sequence of temporal intervals is associated with basal ganglia activity. Two alternative accounts of this striatal activity are possible: "searching" for temporal regularity in early stimulus processing stages or "prediction' of the timing of future tones after the beat is found (relying on continuation of an internally generated beat). To resolve between these accounts, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate different stages of beat perception. Participants heard a series of beat and nonbeat (irregular) monotone sequences. For each sequence, the preceding sequence provided a temporal beat context for the following sequence. Beat sequences were preceded by nonbeat sequences, requiring the beat to be found anew ("beat finding" condition), or by beat sequences with the same beat rate ("beat continuation"), or a different rate ("beat adjustment"). Detection of regularity is highest during beat finding, whereas generation and prediction are highest during beat continuation. We found the greatest striatal activity for beat continuation, less for beat adjustment, and the least for beat finding. Thus, the basal ganglia's response profile suggests a role in beat prediction, not in beat finding.},

abstract = {Variability in adult motor output is important for enabling animals to respond to changing external conditions. Songbirds are useful for studying variability because they alter the amount of variation in their song depending on social context. When an adult zebra finch male sings to a female ("directed"), his song is highly stereotyped, but when he sings alone ("undirected"), his song varies across renditions. Lesions of the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN), the output nucleus of a cortical-basal ganglia circuit for song, reduce song variability to that of the stereotyped "performance" state. However, such lesions not only eliminate LMAN's synaptic input to its targets, but can also cause structural or physiological changes in connected brain regions, and thus cannot assess whether the acute activity of LMAN is important for social modulation of adult song variability. To evaluate the effects of ongoing LMAN activity, we reversibly silenced LMAN in singing zebra finches by bilateral reverse microdialysis of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol. We found that LMAN inactivation acutely reduced undirected song variability, both across and even within syllable renditions, to the level of directed song variability in all birds examined. Song variability returned to pre-muscimol inactivation levels after drug washout. However, unlike LMAN lesions, LMAN inactivation did not eliminate social context effects on song tempo in adult birds. These results indicate that the activity of LMAN neurons acutely and actively generates social context-dependent increases in adult song variability but that social regulation of tempo is more complex.},

abstract = {Songbirds rely on auditory processing of natural communication signals for a number of social behaviors,including mate selection,individual recognition and the rare behavior of vocal learning - the ability to learn vocalizations through imitation of an adult model,rather than by instinct. Like mammals,songbirds possess a set of interconnected ascending and descending auditory brain pathways that process acoustic information and that are presumably involved in the perceptual processing of vocal communication signals. Most auditory areas studied to date are located in the caudomedial forebrain of the songbird and include the thalamo-recipient field L (sub fields L1,L2 and L3),the caudomedial and caudolateral mesopallium (CMM and CLM,respectively) and the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). This review focuses on NCM,an auditory area previously proposed to be analogous to parts of the primary auditory cortex in mammals. Stimulation of songbirds with auditory stimuli drives vigorous electrophysiological responses and the expression of several activity-regulated genes in NCM.Interestingly,NCM neurons are tuned to species-specific songs and undergo some forms of experience-dependent plasticity in-vivo . These activity-dependent changes may underlie long-term modifications in the functional performance of NCM and constitute a potential neural substrate for auditory discrimination. We end this review by discussing evidence that suggests that NCM may be a site of auditory memory formation and/or storage.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in altered inhibitory neurotransmission, hippocampal dysfunction, and cognitive impairments. GABAergic spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) and tonic (extrasynaptic) whole cell currents were recorded in control rat hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) and at 90days after controlled cortical impact (CCI). At 34 degrees C, in CCI DGCs, sIPSC frequency and amplitude were unchanged, whereas mIPSC frequency was decreased (3.10+/-0.84Hz, n=16, and 2.44+/-0.67Hz, n=7, p{\textless}0.05). At 23 degrees C, 300nM diazepam increased peak amplitude of mIPSCs in control and CCI DGCs, but the increase was 20{\%} higher in control (26.81+/-2.2pA and 42.60+/-1.22pA, n=9, p=0.031) compared to CCI DGCs (33.46+/-2.98pA and 46.13+/-1.09pA, n=10, p=0.047). At 34 degrees C, diazepam did not prolong decay time constants (6.59+/-0.12ms and 6.62+/-0.98ms, n=9, p=0.12), the latter suggesting that CCI resulted in benzodiazepine-insensitive pharmacology in synaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). In CCI DGCs, peak amplitude of mIPSCs was inhibited by 100microM furosemide (51.30+/-0.80pA at baseline and 43.50+/-5.30pA after furosemide, n=5, p{\textless}0.001), a noncompetitive antagonist of GABA(A)Rs with an enhanced affinity to alpha4 subunit-containing receptors. Potentiation of tonic current by the GABA(A)R delta subunit-preferring competitive agonist THIP (1 and 3microM) was increased in CCI DGCs (47{\%} and 198{\%}) compared to control DGCs (13{\%} and 162{\%}), suggesting the presence of larger tonic current in CCI DGCs; THIP (1microM) had no effect on mIPSCs. Taken together, these results demonstrate alterations in synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs in DGCs following CCI.},

abstract = {Humans learn and remember motor skills to permit adaptation to a changing environment. During adaptation, the brain develops new sensory-motor relationships that become stored in an internal model (IM) that may be retained for extended periods. How the brain learns new IMs and transforms them into long-term memory remains incompletely understood since prior work has mostly focused on the learning process. A current model suggests that basal ganglia, cerebellum, and their neocortical targets actively participate in forming new IMs but that a cerebellar cortical network would mediate automatization. However, a recent study (Marinelli et al. 2009) reported that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), who have basal ganglia dysfunction, had similar adaptation rates as controls but demonstrated no savings at recall tests (24 and 48 h). Here, we assessed whether a longer training session, a feature known to increase long-term retention of IM in healthy individuals, could allow PD patients to demonstrate savings. We recruited PD patients and age-matched healthy adults and used a visual-motor adaptation paradigm similar to the study by Marinelli et al. (2009), doubling the number of training trials and assessed recall after a short and a 24-h delay. We hypothesized that a longer training session would allow PD patients to develop an enhanced representation of the IM as demonstrated by savings at the recall tests. Our results showed that PD patients had similar adaptation rates as controls but did not demonstrate savings at both recall tests. We interpret these results as evidence that fronto-striatal networks have involvement in the early to late phase of motor memory formation, but not during initial learning.},

abstract = {Diverse evidence suggests that 5-HT uptake blockers enhance learning and memory. However, there is no information about the mechanisms of action involved in such effects. The aim of the present work was to investigate the nature of the receptors involved in the effects of fluoxetine on learning. Therefore, a dose-response curve of posttraining injection (intraperitoneal) of fluoxetine was carried out in an associative learning task (auto-shaping). Fluoxetine or the vehicle was injected 10 min after 5-HT antagonists: (+/-)-pindolol, (+/-)-propanolol, NAN-190, ketanserin, ritanserin, mesulergine, MDL 72222, or SDZ 205-557. Presynaptic activity was eliminated by means of chloroamphetamine pretreatment. Scopolamine (an anticholinergic) and dizocilpine (a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist) were also used. Results showed that fluoxetine enhanced learning of the conditioned response (CR) in a dose-dependent fashion. All 5-HT antagonists had no effects by themselves but inhibited the effects of fluoxetine at different degrees. Decrement of CR produced by scopolamine was reversed by fluoxetine. Dizocilpine did not affect CR but prevented the effects of fluoxetine. The present findings suggest that the actions of fluoxetine on learning are due to an interaction with multiple receptors of postsynaptic nature.},

abstract = {The Drosophila eye is an outstanding model with which to decipher mechanisms of neural differentiation. Paramount to normal eye development is the organized selection and differentiation of a patterned array of R8 photoreceptors - the founding photoreceptor of each ommatidium that coordinates the incorporation of all other photoreceptors. R8 development is a complex process that requires the integration of transcription factors and signaling pathways, many of which are highly conserved and perform similar functions in other species. This article discusses the developmental control of the four key elements of R8 development: selection, spacing, differentiation and orchestration of later events. New questions that have surfaced because of recent advances in the field are addressed, and the unique characteristics of R8 development are highlighted through comparisons with neural specification in other Drosophila tissues and with ganglion cell development in the mammalian retina.},

The present study demonstrated that the blood pressure-reducing response was dependent on the frequency, and was markedly greater at 4 k-16 kHz compared with lower frequencies. These findings suggest that music containing high-frequency sounds stimulates dopamine synthesis, and might thereby regulate and/or affect various brain functions.},

We therefore hypothesized that children would spontaneously synchronize their body movements to an external beat at earlier ages and with higher accuracy if the stimulus was presented in a social context. A total of 36 children in three age groups (2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 years) were invited to drum along with either a human partner, a drumming machine, or a drum sound coming from a speaker. When drumming with a social partner, children as young as 2.5 years adjusted their drumming tempo to a beat outside the range of their spontaneous motor tempo. Moreover, children of all ages synchronized their drumming with higher accuracy in the social condition. We argue that drumming together with a social partner creates a shared representation of the joint action task and/or elicits a specific human motivation to synchronize movements during joint rhythmic activity.},

We studied the relationship between short-latency gamma-band (20-60 Hz) activity (GBA) and the structure of rhythmic tone sequences. We show that induced (non-phase-locked) GBA predicts tone onsets and persists when expected tones are omitted. Evoked (phase-locked) GBA occurs in response to tone onsets with approximately 50 ms latency, and is strongly diminished during tone omissions. These properties of auditory GBA correspond with perception of meter in acoustic sequences and provide evidence for the dynamic allocation of attention to temporally structured auditory sequences.},

abstract = {Humans and other animals must often make decisions on the basis of imperfect evidence. Statisticians use measures such as P values to assign degrees of confidence to propositions, but little is known about how the brain computes confidence estimates about decisions. We explored this issue using behavioural analysis and neural recordings in rats in combination with computational modelling. Subjects were trained to perform an odour categorization task that allowed decision confidence to be manipulated by varying the distance of the test stimulus to the category boundary. To understand how confidence could be computed along with the choice itself, using standard models of decision-making, we defined a simple measure that quantified the quality of the evidence contributing to a particular decision. Here we show that the firing rates of many single neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex match closely to the predictions of confidence models and cannot be readily explained by alternative mechanisms, such as learning stimulus-outcome associations. Moreover, when tested using a delayed reward version of the task, we found that rats' willingness to wait for rewards increased with confidence, as predicted by the theoretical model. These results indicate that confidence estimates, previously suggested to require 'metacognition' and conscious awareness are available even in the rodent brain, can be computed with relatively simple operations, and can drive adaptive behaviour. We suggest that confidence estimation may be a fundamental and ubiquitous component of decision-making.},

abstract = {In the present study, the early right-anterior negativity (ERAN) elicited by harmonically inappropriate chords during listening to music was compared to the frequency mismatch negativity (MMN) and the abstract-feature MMN. Results revealed that the amplitude of the ERAN, in contrast to the MMN, is specifically dependent on the degree of harmonic appropriateness. Thus, the ERAN is correlated with the cognitive processing of complex rule-based information, i.e. with the application of music-syntactic rules. Moreover, results showed that the ERAN, compared to the abstract-feature MMN, had both a longer latency, and a larger amplitude. The combined findings indicate that ERAN and MMN reflect different mechanisms of pre-attentive irregularity detection, and that, although both components have several features in common, the ERAN does not easily fit into the classical MMN framework. The present ERPs thus provide evidence for a differentiation of cognitive processes underlying the fast and pre-attentive processing of auditory information.},

Testing the hypothesis that the mechanism of LTP maintenance stores information requires reversing this mechanism in vivo and finding out whether long-term stored information is lost. This was not previously possible. Recently however, persistent phosphorylation by the atypical protein kinase C isoform, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMz), has been found to maintain late LTP in hippocampal slices. Here we show that a cell-permeable PKMz inhibitor, injected in the rat hippocampus, both reverses LTP maintenance in vivo and produces persistent loss of 1-day-old spatial information. Thus, the mechanism maintaining LTP sustains spatial memory.},

abstract = {Linear measures of auditory receptive fields do not always fully account for a neuron's response to spectrotemporally-complex signals such as frequency-modulated sweeps (FM) and communication sounds. A possible source of this discrepancy is cross-frequency interactions, common response properties which may be missed by linear receptive fields but captured using two-tone masking. Using a patterned tonal sequence that included a balanced set of all possible tone-to-tone transitions, we have here combined the spectrotemporal receptive field with two-tone masking to measure spectrotemporal response maps (STRM). Recording from single units in the mustached bat inferior colliculus, we found significant non-linear interactions between sequential tones in all sampled units. In particular, tone-pair STRMs revealed three common features not visible in linear single-tone STRMs: 1) two-tone facilitative interactions, 2) frequency-specific suppression, and 3) post-stimulatory suppression in the absence of spiking. We also found a correlative relationship between these nonlinear receptive field features and sensitivity for different rates and directions of FM sweeps, dynamic features found in many vocalizations, including speech. The overwhelming prevalence of cross-frequency interactions revealed by this technique provides further evidence of the central auditory system's role as a pattern-detector, and underscores the need to include nonlinearity in measures of the receptive field.},

abstract = {Mushroom bodies are a well-known site for associative learning in insects. Yet the precise mechanisms that underlie plasticity there and ensure their specificity remain elusive. In locusts, the synapses between the intrinsic mushroom body neurons and their postsynaptic targets obey a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. Although this property homeostatically regulates the timing of mushroom body output, its potential role in associative learning is unknown. Here we show in vivo that pre-post pairing causing STDP can, when followed by the local delivery of a reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator, specify the synapses that will undergo an associative change. At these synapses, and there only, the change is a transformation of the STDP rule itself. These results illustrate the multiple actions of STDP, including a role in associative learning, despite potential temporal dissociation between the pairings that specify synaptic modification and the delivery of reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator signals.},

Using a go/no-go procedure, subjects were trained to discriminate between speech syllables arranged in XYXY patterns with prosodic stress on the first syllable and XXYY patterns with prosodic stress on the final syllable. To systematically determine the salience of the various prosodic cues (pitch, duration and amplitude) to the zebra finches, they were subjected to five tests with different combinations of these cues. The zebra finches generalized the prosodic pattern to sequences that consisted of new syllables and used prosodic features over structural ones to discriminate between stimuli. This strong sensitivity to the prosodic pattern was maintained when only a single prosodic cue was available. The change in pitch was treated as more salient than changes in the other prosodic features. These results show that zebra finches are sensitive to the same prosodic cues known to affect human speech perception.},

The objective of this study was to confirm somatosensory-auditory interaction in A1 and to define both its physiological mechanisms and its consequences for auditory information processing. Laminar current source density and multiunit activity sampled during multielectrode penetrations of primary auditory area A1 in awake macaques revealed clear somatosensory-auditory interactions, with a novel mechanism: somatosensory inputs appear to reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations, so that accompanying auditory inputs arrive during an ideal, high-excitability phase, and produce amplified neuronal responses. In contrast, responses to auditory inputs arriving during the opposing low-excitability phase tend to be suppressed. Our findings underscore the instrumental role of neuronal oscillations in cortical operations. The timing and laminar profile of the multisensory interactions in A1 indicate that nonspecific thalamic systems may play a key role in the effect.},

abstract = {Many models of eyeblink conditioning assume that there is a simple linear relationship between the firing patterns of neurons in the interpositus nucleus and the time course of the conditioned response (CR). However, the complexities of muscle behaviour and plant dynamics call this assumption into question. We investigated the issue by implementing the most detailed model available of the rabbit nictitating membrane response (Bartha and Thompson in Biol Cybern 68:135-143, 1992a and in Biol Cybern 68:145-154, 1992b), in which each motor unit of the retractor bulbi muscle is represented by a Hill-type model, driven by a non-linear activation mechanism designed to reproduce the isometric force measurements of Lennerstrand (J Physiol 236:43-55, 1974). Globe retraction and NM extension are modelled as linked second order systems. We derived versions of the model that used a consistent set of SI units, were based on a physically realisable version of calcium kinetics, and used simulated muscle cross-bridges to produce force. All versions showed similar non-linear responses to two basic control strategies. (1) Rate-coding with no recruitment gave a sigmoidal relation between control signal and amplitude of CR, reflecting the measured relation between isometric muscle force and stimulation frequency. (2) Recruitment of similar strength motor units with no rate coding gave a sublinear relation between control signal and amplitude of CR, reflecting the increase in muscle stiffness produced by recruitment. However, the system response could be linearised by either a suitable combination of rate-coding and recruitment, or by simple recruitment of motor units in order of (exponentially) increasing strength. These plausible control strategies, either alone or in combination, would in effect present the cerebellum with the simplified virtual plant that is assumed in many models of eyeblink conditioning. Future work is therefore needed to determine the extent to which motor neuron firing is in fact linearly related to the nictitating membrane response.},

abstract = {It has been argued that both modality-specific and supramodal mechanisms dedicated to time perception underlie the estimation of interval durations. While it is generally assumed that early sensory areas are dedicated to modality-specific time estimation, we hypothesized that early sensory areas such as the primary visual cortex or the auditory cortex might be involved in time perception independently of the sensory modality of the input. To test this possibility, we examined whether disruption of the primary visual cortex or the auditory cortex would disrupt time estimation of auditory stimuli and visual stimuli using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We found that disruption of the auditory cortex impaired not only time estimation of auditory stimuli but also impaired that of visual stimuli to the same degree. This finding suggests a supramodal role of the auditory cortex in time perception. On the other hand, TMS over the primary visual cortex impaired performance only in visual time discrimination. These asymmetric contributions of the auditory and visual cortices in time perception may be explained by a superiority of the auditory cortex in temporal processing. Here, we propose that time is primarily encoded in the auditory system and that visual inputs are automatically encoded into an auditory representation in time discrimination tasks.},

abstract = {We used retrograde transneuronal transport of neurotropic viruses in Cebus monkeys to examine the organization of basal ganglia and cerebellar projections to two cortical areas on the medial wall of the hemisphere, the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the pre-SMA. We found that both of these cortical areas are the targets of disynaptic projections from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). On average, the number of pallidal neurons that project to the SMA and pre-SMA is approximately three to four times greater than the number of dentate neurons that project to these cortical areas. GPi neurons that project to the pre-SMA are located in a rostral, "associative" territory of the nucleus, whereas GPi neurons that project to the SMA are located in a more caudal and ventral "sensorimotor" territory. Similarly, dentate neurons that project to the pre-SMA are located in a ventral, "nonmotor" domain of the nucleus, whereas dentate neurons that project to the SMA are located in a more dorsal, "motor" domain. The differential origin of subcortical projections to the SMA and pre-SMA suggests that these cortical areas are nodes in distinct neural systems. Although both systems are the target of outputs from the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, these two cortical areas seem to be dominated by basal ganglia input.},

abstract = {Rhythm is important in the production of motor sequences such as speech and song. Deficits in rhythm processing have been implicated in human disorders that affect speech and language processing, including stuttering, autism, and dyslexia. Songbirds provide a tractable model for studying the neural underpinnings of rhythm processing due to parallels with humans in neural structures and vocal learning patterns. In this study, adult zebra finches were exposed to naturally rhythmic conspecific song or arrhythmic song. Immunohistochemistry for the immediate early gene ZENK was used to detect neural activation in response to these two types of stimuli. ZENK was increased in response to arrhythmic song in the auditory association cortex homologs, caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and caudomedial mesopallium (CMM), and the avian amygdala, nucleus taeniae (Tn). CMM also had greater ZENK labeling in females than males. The increased neural activity in NCM and CMM during perception of arrhythmic stimuli parallels increased activity in the human auditory cortex following exposure to unexpected, or perturbed, auditory stimuli. These auditory areas may be detecting errors in arrhythmic song when comparing it to a stored template of how conspecific song is expected to sound. CMM may also be important for females in evaluating songs of potential mates. In the context of other research in songbirds, we suggest that the increased activity in Tn may be related to the value of song for assessing mate choice and bonding or it may be related to perception of arrhythmic song as aversive.},

Researchers have demonstrated the cerebellum also plays a role in learning, memory, and more recent evidence for contributions in language, attention, working memory, emotions, and social processes. Here, we present a study that adds to the list of nonmotor processes of the cerebellum. We used images of faces and outdoor scenes to examine the cerebellar response to familiar and novel stimuli. Participants were familiarized with a subset of stimuli, and then underwent functional MRI (fMRI) where they were presented with the previously stimuli and new stimuli while making 'old' and 'new' judgment. In a familiar versus novel contrast, familiar stimuli (faces and scenes combined) activated bilateral regions of the cerebellum including I–IV, V, VI, Crus I, and Crus II. When separated by type, familiar faces had greater activation of bilateral I–IV than novel faces. These results demonstrate the cerebellar role in determining familiarity and contribute to continuing research supporting cerebellar contributions to nonmotor processes.

abstract = {Forebrain association areas interweave perceived stimuli with acquired representations of own actions and their outcome. Often, relevant stimuli come in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes and we slowly have to learn to group them into meaningful categories. Therefore, the aim of the present study was twofold: First, to reveal how single units in the pigeon's nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a functional analogue of the mammalian prefrontal cortex (PFC), encode stimuli that differ in visual features but not in behavioral relevance. The second aim was to understand how these categorical representations are established during learning. Recordings were made from NCL neurons while pigeons performed a go-nogo categorization paradigm. Responses during presentation of the two S+ stimuli and non-responding during presentation of the two S- stimuli were followed by reward. We recorded from two pigeons at different learning stages. In the beginning of the learning process, neurons were active during and shortly before reward, but only in go trials. These data suggest that during the early phase of learning avian 'prefrontal' neurons code for rewards associated with the same behavioral demand, while ignoring feature differences of stimuli within one category. When learning progressed, (1) category selectivity became stronger, (2) responses selective for nogo stimuli appeared, and (3) reward-related responses disappeared in favor of category-selective responses during the stimulus phase. This backward shift in time resembles response patterns assumed by the temporal difference (TD) model of reinforcement learning, but goes beyond it, since it reflects the neuronal correlate of functional categories. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We learn complex skills such as speech and dance through a gradual process of trial and error. Cortical-basal ganglia circuits have an important yet unresolved function in this trial-and-error skill learning; influential 'actor-critic' models propose that basal ganglia circuits generate a variety of behaviours during training and learn to implement the successful behaviours in their repertoire. Here we show that the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a cortical-basal ganglia circuit, contributes to skill learning even when it does not contribute to such 'exploratory' variation in behavioural performance during training. Blocking the output of the AFP while training Bengalese finches to modify their songs prevented the gradual improvement that normally occurs in this complex skill during training. However, unblocking the output of the AFP after training caused an immediate transition from naive performance to excellent performance, indicating that the AFP covertly gained the ability to implement learned skill performance without contributing to skill practice. In contrast, inactivating the output nucleus of the AFP during training completely prevented learning, indicating that learning requires activity within the AFP during training. Our results suggest a revised model of skill learning: basal ganglia circuits can monitor the consequences of behavioural variation produced by other brain regions and then direct those brain regions to implement more successful behaviours. The ability of the AFP to identify successful performances generated by other brain regions indicates that basal ganglia circuits receive a detailed efference copy of premotor activity in those regions. The capacity of the AFP to implement successful performances that were initially produced by other brain regions indicates precise functional connections between basal ganglia circuits and the motor regions that directly control performance.},

abstract = {Learning causes a change in how information is processed by neuronal circuits. Whereas synaptic plasticity, an important cellular mechanism, has been studied in great detail, we know much less about how learning is implemented at the level of neuronal circuits and, in particular, how interactions between distinct types of neurons within local networks contribute to the process of learning. Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning. Together, these data demonstrate that stimulus convergence in the auditory cortex is necessary for associative fear learning to complex tones, define the circuit elements mediating this convergence and suggest that layer-1-mediated disinhibition is an important mechanism underlying learning and information processing in neocortical circuits.},

abstract = {The neural processing of sensory stimuli involves a transformation of physical stimulus parameters into perceptual features, and elucidating where and how this transformation occurs is one of the ultimate aims of sensory neurophysiology. Recent studies have shown that the firing of neurons in early sensory cortex can be modulated by multisensory interactions [1-5], motor behavior [1, 3, 6, 7], and reward feedback [1, 8, 9], but it remains unclear whether neural activity is more closely tied to perception, as indicated by behavioral choice, or to the physical properties of the stimulus. We investigated which of these properties are predominantly represented in auditory cortex by recording local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit spiking activity in ferrets while they discriminated the pitch of artificial vowels. We found that auditory cortical activity is informative both about the fundamental frequency (F0) of a target sound and also about the pitch that the animals appear to perceive given their behavioral responses. Surprisingly, although the stimulus F0 was well represented at the onset of the target sound, neural activity throughout auditory cortex frequently predicted the reported pitch better than the target F0.},

abstract = {Associating reward to task performance has been shown to benefit scores of cognitive functions. Importantly, this typically entails associating reward to the execution of a response, hence intertwining action-related processes with motivational ones. However, recently, preparatory action requirements (go/no-go) and outcome valence (reward/punishment) were elegantly separated using a cued orthogonalized go/no-go task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results from this task showed that typical areas of the “reward network,” like the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatum, predominantly encode action rather than valence, displaying enhanced activity when preparing for action (go) compared to inaction (no-go). In the current study, we used ERPs to probe for differences in preparatory state related to cognitive effort in this task, which has similarly been linked to reward-network activity. Importantly, the contingent negative variation, which is linked to effortful cognitive preparation processes during cue-target intervals, was clearly observed in go trials but not in no-go trials. Moreover, target-locked ERP results (N1 and P3) suggested that attention to the target was enhanced when an action had to be performed (go trials), and typical inhibition-related ERP components were not observed in no-go trials, suggesting a lack of active response inhibition. Finally, feedback-related P3 results could suggest that correct feedback was valued more in motivated go trials, again implying that more effort was required to correctly perform the task. Together, these results indicate that the anticipation of action compared to inaction simultaneously entails differences in mental effort, highlighting the need for further dissociation of these concepts.},

When direct mossy fiber stimulation was then given, the animals responded with conditioned blinks immediately, that is, without ever having been trained to the mossy fiber stimulation. Antidromic activation was prevented by blocking mossy fibers with lignocaine ventral to the stimulation site. It could be excluded that cerebellar output functioned as the CS. Analysis of latencies suggests that conditioned responses (CRs) are not generated by mossy fiber collaterals to the deep nuclei.

abstract = {Disturbances of the serotoninergic neuromodulation in the cerebellar cortex have been involved in several types of ataxia, but the physiological action of serotonin in this structure remains poorly understood. We report that in slices of the rat cerebellar vermis, serotonin triggers the firing of an inhibitory interneuron presynaptic to Golgi cells. The Lugaro cell, a neglected interneuronal type, satisfies the expected criteria for this input, whereas basket cells, stellate cells, or Golgi cells do not. Lugaro cells are selectively excited by serotonin, and their firing behavior (sustained steady frequency in the 5-15 Hz range) resembles the pattern of occurrence of serotonin-evoked IPSCs in Golgi cells. Immunohistochemical stainings and single cell reconstructions show that Lugaro cell axons form a parasagittal plexus but also extend long transverse branches that run parallel to the parallel fibers and are partly myelinated. Electrophysiological data suggest that these transverse axons participate in synaptic contacts of the Lugaro cells with Golgi cells, and we calculated that in the intact cerebellum a given Lugaro cell contacts {\textgreater}100 Golgi cells. Serotonin modulation of Lugaro cells may constitute an intracortical switch involved in information patterning at the level of Golgi cells and granule cells populations, and particularly in synchronizations recorded along the transverse axis in vivo.},

abstract = {The brains of adult zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) are tuned to the songs of conspecifics. In adult males, the caudomedial neostriatum (NCM) responds to zebra finch song, and in adult females the NCM and hippocampus (HP) are active following exposure to zebra finch song more than other auditory stimuli. The caudal hyperstriatum ventrale (cHV) in both sexes also responds to song, but in females not as selectively as the NCM and HP. While much is known about the adult perceptual circuit, less is known about its development. The present study exposed d30 male and female zebra finches to conspecific or heterospecific song, tones or silence, and examined the densities of FOS- and ZENK-immunoreactive nuclei in the NCM, cHV and HP. Significant interactions existed between sex and auditory stimulus condition for both immediate early genes, but they were in opposite directions. That is, across the three regions, FOS-immunoreactive neurons were increased in females following presentation of conspecific songs; males did not show an effect of stimulus exposure. In contrast, the density of ZENK-positive neurons was increased in males, but not females, following zebra finch song exposure. The FOS results demonstrate that some neural responses required for song perception may develop earlier in females than males; data on ZENK induction suggest the opposite. Overall, differences in juvenile immediate early gene activation suggest either that males and females employ divergent neural mechanisms for song perception or that the developmental trajectories leading to common neural responses differ.},

Training the birds to go for the conspecifics song or to go for the heterospecific song required the same number of training sessions. Nine possible cognitive tactics could be used to solve this task, but probe tests revealed that the birds used only four. Six birds memorized only the "no-go" stimulus and responded to the rest of the stimuli (no-go memory), two birds classified songs according to the species category (open-ended categorization), one bird memorized both of the training stimuli but responded by chance to the probe stimuli (rote categorization), and two birds combined open-ended and rote categorization tactics (combined categorization). These tactics were related to the number of sessions needed to reach the species-discrimination criterion. Our results suggest that investigators should consider individual cognitive tactics and the pitfalls of go/no-go discrimination when interpreting the results of operant discrimination tasks.},

abstract = {Working memory, the ability to temporarily retain task-relevant information across a delay, is frequently investigated using delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) or delayed Go/No-Go tasks (DGNG). In DMTS tasks, sample cues instruct the animal which type of response has to be executed at the end of a delay. Typically, performance decreases with increasing delay duration, indicating that working memory fades across a delay. However, no such performance decrease has been found when the sample cues exist of present vs. absent stimuli, suggesting that pigeons do not rely on working memory, but seem to respond by default in those trials. We trained 3 pigeons in a DGNG task and found a similar default response pattern: The diverging slopes of the retention functions on correct Go and No-Go trials suggested that pigeons by default omitted their response following No-Go stimuli, but actively retained task-relevant information across the delay for successful responses on Go trials. We conducted single-cell recordings in the avian nidopallium caudolaterale, a structure comparable to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. On Go trials, many neurons displayed sustained elevated activity during the delay preceding the response, replicating previous findings and suggesting that task-relevant information was neurally represented and maintained across the delay. However, the same units did not show enhanced delay activity preceding correct response suppressions in No-Go trials. This activation-inactivation pattern presumably constitutes a neural correlate of the default response strategy observed in the DGNG task.},

A brief overview of biological injury processes that impinge on the aging brain is provided, and their overall effect on the integrity of neural architecture is described. Cognitive decline associated with aging, and white matter connectivity degradation as a biological substrate for that decline, is then described. We then briefly describe the technology of DTI as a means for in vivo, non-invasive interrogation of white matter connectivity, and relate it to FLAIR, a more traditional MRI method for assessing white matter injury. We then survey the existing findings on relationships between aging-associated neuropathological processes and DTI measurements on one hand; and relationships between DTI measurements and late-life cognitive function on the other. We conclude with a summary of current research directions in relation to DTI studies of cognitive aging.},

abstract = {The evolution of the eye is a matter of debate ever since Darwin's Origin of Species. While morphological comparisons of eye anatomy and photoreceptor cell types led to the view that animal eyes evolved multiple times independently, the molecular conservation of the pax6 eye-specifying cascade has indicated the contrary - that animal eyes evolved from a common, simple precursor, the proto-eye. Morphological and molecular comparative approaches are combined here in a novel Evo-Devo approach, the molecular comparison of cell types ("comparative molecular cell biology"). In the eye, the various types of photoreceptor cells, as well as pigment and lens cells, each require distinct combinations of specifying transcription factors that control their particular differentiation programmes, such as opsin expression in photoreceptors, specific neurotransmitter metabolism, or axonal outgrowth. Comparing the molecular combinatorial codes of cell types of animal extant eyes, their evolutionary histories can be reconstructed. This is exemplified here on the evolution of ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in bilaterian eyes and on the evolution of cell type diversity in the vertebrate retina. I propose that the retinal ganglion, amacrine and horizontal cells are evolutionary sister cell types that evolved from a common rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell precursor.},

These circadian and stress-related responses are achieved by two highly conserved and interrelated regulatory networks, the circadian CLOCK and stress systems, which respectively consist of oscillating molecular pacemakers, the Clock/Bmal1 transcription factors, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its end-effector, the glucocorticoid receptor. These systems communicate with one another at different signaling levels and dysregulation of either system can lead to development of pathologic conditions. In this review, we summarize the mutual physiologic interactions between the circadian CLOCK system and the HPA axis, and discuss their clinical implications.},

abstract = {Female songbirds use male songs as an important criterion for mate selection. Properties of male songs are thought to indicate the male's quality as a potential mate. Song preferences in female zebra finches are known to be influenced by two factors - early auditory experience and the acoustic characteristics of males' songs. Studies often investigate song preferences by priming females with estrogen. However, estrogenic influences on song preferences have not been studied. We investigated the relative influence of early auditory experience, acoustic features of songs, and estrogen availability on song responsiveness in female zebra finches. Juvenile female zebra finches were tutored for 10??days with 40 songs per day with one of three acoustically different song types - simple songs, long-bout songs or complex songs. A fourth group of females was untutored. Aside from this brief song exposure, females were raised and maintained without exposure to male songs. During adulthood, females' behavioral responses to the three song types were tested under three hormone conditions - untreated, estradiol-treated and 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD)-treated (to lower endogenous estrogen). Based on the results of our study, four conclusions can be drawn. First, song responsiveness in female zebra finches is strongly affected by minimal early acoustic experience. Second, inexperienced female zebra finches are inherently biased to respond more to complex songs over other song types Third, although female zebra finches are inherently biased to respond more to complex songs, early acoustic experience may either reinforce or weaken this inherent responsiveness to complex songs. Fourth, estrogen selectively accentuates song responsiveness in acoustically-experienced female zebra finches. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, despite decades of clinical and scientific investigation, there is no unifying theory of EEG organization, and the role of ongoing activity in sensory processing remains controversial. This study analyzed laminar profiles of synaptic activity [current source density CSD] and multiunit activity (MUA), both spontaneous and stimulus-driven, in primary auditory cortex of awake macaque monkeys. Our results reveal that the EEG is hierarchically organized; delta (1-4 Hz) phase modulates theta (4-10 Hz) amplitude, and theta phase modulates gamma (30-50 Hz) amplitude. This oscillatory hierarchy controls baseline excitability and thus stimulus-related responses in a neuronal ensemble. We propose that the hierarchical organization of ambient oscillatory activity allows auditory cortex to structure its temporal activity pattern so as to optimize the processing of rhythmic inputs.},

HVC receives new neurons in adulthood. Most of the new neurons project to RA and replace other neurons of the same kind. We show here that singing enhances mRNA and protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the HVC of adult male canaries, Serinus canaria. The increased BDNF expression is proportional to the number of songs produced per unit time. Singing-induced BDNF expression in HVC occurs mainly in the RA-projecting neurons. Neuronal survival was compared among birds that did or did not sing during days 31-38 after BrdUrd injection. Survival of new HVC neurons is greater in the singing birds than in the nonsinging birds. A positive causal link between pathway use, neurotrophin expression, and new neuron survival may be common among systems that recruit new neurons in adulthood.},

However there are no agreed norms for the absolute concentrations of free cortisol in saliva either immediately post-awakening (range of 4.7-18.5 nmol/l) or 30 min post-awakening (range of 8.6-21.9 nmol/l). This review explores reasons for these discrepancies in normative data including confounding factors such as gender, age, awakening time, light and participant adherence. Although the physiological role of the ACR has not been clearly defined evidence is discussed that suggests it is under a distinct regulatory influence, different from the rest of the diurnal cortisol secretory cycle. Despite the difficulties associated with its measurement a range of studies have demonstrated an association between the ACR and psychosocial variables, stress and health. However it remains unclear whether positive affect and good health are consistently associated with larger or smaller awakening responses. It is early days in the search for the role and significance of the ACR. Its putative role in the regulation of physiological function across the day (e.g. the immune system) and its sensitivity to psychosocial variables make it a prime candidate as an intermediary linking mind and health.},

abstract = {We generated transgenic (Thy1alpha6) mice in which the GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunit, whose expression is usually confined to granule cells of cerebellum and cochlear nuclei, is ectopically expressed under the control of the pan-neuronal Thy-1.2 promoter. Strong Thy1alpha6 subunit expression occurs, for example, in deep cerebellar nuclei, layer V iscocortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells. Ligand binding and protein biochemistry show that most forebrain alpha6 subunits assemble as alpha6betagamma2-type receptors, and some as alpha1alpha6betagamma2 and alpha3alpha6betagamma2 receptors. Electron microscopic immunogold labeling shows that most Thy1-derived alpha6 immunoreactivity is in the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of dendrites and spines in both layer V isocortical and CA1pyramidal cells. Synaptic immunolabeling is rare. Consistent with the alpha6 subunits' extrasynaptic localization, Thy1alpha6 CA1 pyramidal neurons have a five-fold increased tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated current compared with wild-type cells; however, the spontaneous IPSC frequency and the mIPSC amplitude in Thy1alpha6 mice decrease 37 and 30{\%}, respectively compared with wild-type. Our results strengthen the idea that GABA(A) receptors containing alpha6 subunits can function as extrasynaptic receptors responsible for tonic inhibition and further suggest that a homeostatic mechanism might operate, whereby increased tonic inhibition causes a compensatory decrease in synaptic GABA(A) receptor responses.},

abstract = {The tracking of rhythmic structure is a vital component of speech and music perception. It is known that sequences of identical sounds can give rise to the percept of alternating strong and weak sounds, and that this percept is linked to enhanced cortical and oscillatory responses. The neural correlates of the perception of rhythm elicited by ecologically valid, complex stimuli, however, remain unexplored. Here we report the effects of a stimulus' alignment with the beat on the brain's processing of sound. Human subjects listened to short popular music pieces while simultaneously hearing a target sound. Cortical and brainstem electrophysiological onset responses to the sound were enhanced when it was presented on the beat of the music, as opposed to shifted away from it. Moreover, the size of the effect of alignment with the beat on the cortical response correlated strongly with the ability to tap to a beat, suggesting that the ability to synchronize to the beat of simple isochronous stimuli and the ability to track the beat of complex, ecologically valid stimuli may rely on overlapping neural resources. These results suggest that the perception of musical rhythm may have robust effects on processing throughout the auditory system.},

In a series of standards and oddballs, the participants compared the duration of the oddballs to that of the standards. Results showed asymmetric cross-modal effects, supporting the auditory dominance hypothesis: a sound extends the perceived visual duration, whereas a visual object has no effect on perceived auditory duration.

@article{Mello2004,
abstract = {We review here evidence that a large portion of the caudomedial telencephalon of songbirds, distinct from the song control circuit, is involved in the perceptual processing of birdsong. When songbirds hear song, a number of caudomedial pallial areas are activated, as revealed by expression of the activity-dependent gene zenk. These areas, which include field L subfields L1 and L3, as well as the adjacent caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and caudomedial mesopallium (CMM), are part of the central auditory pathway and constitute a lobule in the caudomedial aspect of the telencephalon. Several lines of evidence indicate that the neural circuits integrating this lobule are capable of performing the auditory processing of song based on fine acoustic features. Thus, this lobule is well positioned to mediate song perceptual processing and discrimination, which are required for vocal communication and vocal learning. Importantly, the zenk gene encodes a transcription factor linked to synaptic plasticity, and it regulates the expression of target genes associated with specific neuronal cell functions. The induction of zenk likely represents a key regulatory event in a gene cascade triggered by song and leading to neuronal plasticity. Thus, zenk may be linked to molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying experience-dependent modification of song-responsive circuits. In summary, songbirds possess an elaborate system for song perceptual processing and discrimination that potentially also subserves song-induced neuronal plasticity and song memory formation. The continued use of a multidisciplinary approach that integrates molecular, anatomical, physiological and behavioral methodologies has the potential to provide further significant insights into the underlying neurobiology of the perceptual aspects of vocal communication and learning.},

abstract = {The basal ganglia-recipient thalamus receives inhibitory inputs from the pallidum and excitatory inputs from cortex, but it is unclear how these inputs interact during behavior. We recorded simultaneously from thalamic neurons and their putative synaptically connected pallidal inputs in singing zebra finches. We find, first, that each pallidal spike produces an extremely brief (∼5 ms) pulse of inhibition that completely suppresses thalamic spiking. As a result, thalamic spikes are entrained to pallidal spikes with submillisecond precision. Second, we find that the number of thalamic spikes that discharge within a single pallidal interspike interval (ISI) depends linearly on the duration of that interval but does not depend on pallidal activity prior to the interval. In a detailed biophysical model, our results were not easily explained by the postinhibitory "rebound" mechanism previously observed in anesthetized birds and in brain slices, nor could most of our data be characterized as "gating" of excitatory transmission by inhibitory pallidal input. Instead, we propose a novel "entrainment" mechanism of pallidothalamic transmission that highlights the importance of an excitatory conductance that drives spiking, interacting with brief pulses of pallidal inhibition. Building on our recent finding that cortical inputs can drive syllable-locked rate modulations in thalamic neurons during singing, we report here that excitatory inputs affect thalamic spiking in two ways: by shortening the latency of a thalamic spike after a pallidal spike and by increasing thalamic firing rates within individual pallidal ISIs. We present a unifying biophysical model that can reproduce all known modes of pallidothalamic transmission--rebound, gating, and entrainment--depending on the amount of excitation the thalamic neuron receives.},

In the most basic formulation, STDP provides a fundamental unit - a spike pair - for quantifying the induction of long-term changes in synaptic strength. However, many factors, both pre- and postsynaptic, can affect synaptic transmission and integration, especially when multiple spikes are considered. Here we review the experimental evidence for multiple types of nonlinear temporal interactions in STDP, focusing on the contributions of individual spike pairs, overall spike rate, and precise spike timing for modification of cortical and hippocampal excitatory synapses. We discuss the underlying processes that determine the specific learning rules at different synapses, such as postsynaptic excitability and short-term depression. Finally, we describe the success of efforts toward building predictive, quantitative models of how complex and natural spike trains induce long-term synaptic modifications.},

abstract = {This paper is divided into three sections. The first section is theoretical; it extends Dynamic Attending Theory (Jones, M. R. Psychological Review 83 (1976) 323; Jones, M. R. Perception and Psychophysics 41(6) (1987) 631; Jones, M. R. Psychomusicology 9(2) (1990) 193; Jones, M. R., {\&} Boltz, M. Psychological Review 96(3) (1989) 459) to developmental questions concerning tempo and time hierarchies. Generally Dynamic Attending Theory proposes that, when listening to a complex auditory sequence, listeners spontaneously focus on events occurring at an intermediate rate (the referent level), and they then may shift attention to events occurring over longer or shorter time spans, that is at lower (faster) or higher (slower) hierarchical levels (focal attending). The second section of the paper is experimental. It examines maturational changes of three dynamic attending activities involving referent period and level, attunement, and focal attending. Tasks involve both motor tapping (including spontaneous motor tempo and synchronization with simple sequences and music) and tempo discrimination. We compare performances by 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-old children and adults, with or without musical training. Results indicate three changes with increased age and musical training: (1) a slowing of the mean spontaneous tapping rate (a reflection of the referent period) and mean synchronization rate (a reflection of the referent level), (2) enhanced ability to synchronize tapping and discriminate tempo (improved attunement), and (3) an enlarged range of tapping rates towards slower rates and higher hierarchical levels (improved focal attending). A final section considers results in light of the theory proposed here. It is suggested that growth trends can be expressed in terms of listeners' engagement of slower attending oscillators with age and experience, accompanied by the passage from the initial use of a single oscillator towards the coupling of multiple oscillators.},

abstract = {Cellular responsiveness to nitric oxide (NO) is shaped by past history of NO exposure. The mechanisms behind this plasticity were explored using rat platelets in vitro, specifically to determine the relative contributions made by desensitization of NO receptors, which couple to cGMP formation, and by phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5), which is activated by cGMP and also hydrolyzes it. Repeated delivery of brief NO pulses (50 nM peak) at 1-min intervals resulted in a progressive loss of the associated cGMP responses, which was the combined consequence of receptor desensitization and PDE5 activation, with the former dominating. Delivery of pulses of differing amplitude showed that NO stimulated and desensitized receptors with similar potency (EC50 = 10-20 nM). PDE5 activation was highly sensitive to NO, with a single pulse peaking at 2 nM being sufficient to evoke a 50{\%} loss of response to a subsequent near-maximal NO pulse. However, the activated state of the PDE subsided quickly after removal of NO, the half-time for recovery being 25 s. In contrast, receptor desensitization reverted much more slowly, the half-time being 16 min. Accordingly, with long (20-min) exposures, NO concentrations as low as 600 pM provoked significant desensitization. The results indicate that PDE5 activation and receptor desensitization subserve distinct short term and longer term roles as mediators of plasticity in NO-cGMP signaling. A kinetic model explicitly describing the complex interplay between NO concentration, cGMP synthesis, PDE5 activation, and the resulting cGMP accumulation successfully simulated the present and previous data.},

abstract = {In visual Go/Nogo tasks the ERP usually shows a frontal negativity after Nogo stimuli (“Nogo-N2”), which possibly reflects an inhibition process. However, the Nogo-N2 appears to be very small after auditory stimuli, which is evidence against the inhibition hypothesis. In the present study we tested this hypothesis by evaluating performance differences between subjects. Assuming that for Ss with a high false alarm rate the inhibition process is weakened and/or delayed, they should reveal a smaller and/or later Nogo-N2 than Ss with a low false alarm rate. This prediction was confirmed, which supports the inhibition hypothesis. However, the Nogo-N2 was again much smaller and had a different topography after auditory than after visual stimuli despite similar performance in both modalities. This modality asymmetry was explained by assuming that the inhibitory mechanism reflected in the Nogo-N2 is located at a pre-motor rather than at the motor level. In the second part of the study we compared the Nogo-N2 with a similar phenomenon, the error negativity (Ne), which occurs in trials with commission errors (false alarms). Earlier work suggests that the Ne is a correlate of error detection or inhibition. This raises the possibility that the Ne is a delayed Nogo-N2, i.e., the Ne may reflect a late and hence unsuccessful attempt to inhibit the response after a nontarget. However, the Ne amplitude showed no difference between performance groups and stimulus modalities, as found for the Nogo-N2. Moreover, Ne and Nogo-N2 had different scalp topographies. This suggests that different mechanisms and generators underlie the Ne and the Nogo-N2.},

abstract = {Hand-reared female chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, were tape-tutored just after fledging. In the subsequent spring (i.e. their first breeding season) they were successfully trained in an operant conditioning task where they could trigger song playback by perching on either of two short lever-type perches. In a given trial, one of the four songs that had been used for tutoring was paired with a song type unknown to the subject. The subjects showed no overall preference for either the familiar or unfamiliar song types. In a second experiment one breeding season later, the same females were confronted with two versions of one song with and without the species-specific terminal flourish. The majority of females preferred the version with a terminal flourish. The results of this preliminary study suggest that, at least in our small laboratory sample, female chaffinch song preferences vary individually for songs within the species-specific range and that exposure to a particular song type early in life plays a minor role, if any, in forming their preferences. Operant conditioning with song as a reinforcer can be used in the laboratory as an alternative method to measures of approach to test individual females' song preferences, with the great advantage that the control over the stimulus is left with the subject.},

abstract = {Sensory driven immediate early gene expression (IEG) has been a key tool to explore auditory perceptual areas in the avian brain. Most work on IEG expression in songbirds such as zebra finches has focused on playback of acoustic stimuli and its effect on auditory processing areas such as caudal medial mesopallium (CMM) caudal medial nidopallium (NCM). However, in a natural setting, the courtship displays of songbirds (including zebra finches) include visual as well as acoustic components. To determine whether the visual stimulus of a courting male modifies song-induced expression of the IEG ZENK in the auditory forebrain we exposed male and female zebra finches to acoustic (song) and visual (dancing) components of courtship. Birds were played digital movies with either combined audio and video, audio only, video only, or neither audio nor video (control). We found significantly increased levels of Zenk response in the auditory region CMM in the two treatment groups exposed to acoustic stimuli compared to the control group. The video only group had an intermediate response, suggesting potential effect of visual input on activity in these auditory brain regions. Finally, we unexpectedly found a lateralization of Zenk response that was independent of sex, brain region, or treatment condition, such that Zenk immunoreactivity was consistently higher in the left hemisphere than in the right and the majority of individual birds were left-hemisphere dominant. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Songbirds provide rich natural models for studying the relationships between brain anatomy, behavior, environmental signals, and gene expression. Under the Songbird Neurogenomics Initiative, investigators from 11 laboratories collected brain samples from six species of songbird under a range of experimental conditions, and 488 of these samples were analyzed systematically for gene expression by microarray. ANOVA was used to test 32 planned contrasts in the data, revealing the relative impact of different factors. The brain region from which tissue was taken had the greatest influence on gene expression profile, affecting the majority of signals measured by 18,848 cDNA spots on the microarray. Social and environmental manipulations had a highly variable impact, interpreted here as a manifestation of paradoxical "constitutive plasticity" (fewer inducible genes) during periods of enhanced behavioral responsiveness. Several specific genes were identified that may be important in the evolution of linkages between environmental signals and behavior. The data were also analyzed using weighted gene coexpression network analysis, followed by gene ontology analysis. This revealed modules of coexpressed genes that are also enriched for specific functional annotations, such as "ribosome" (expressed more highly in juvenile brain) and "dopamine metabolic process" (expressed more highly in striatal song control nucleus area X). These results underscore the complexity of influences on neural gene expression and provide a resource for studying how these influences are integrated during natural experience.},

abstract = {Debate surrounds the issue of how the large, metabolically expensive brains of Homo sapiens can be energetically afforded. At the evolutionary level, decreased investment in muscularity, adiposity and the digestive tract allow for a larger brain. Developmentally, high neo-natal adiposity and preferential distribution of resources to the brain provide an energetic buffer during times of environmental stress. Through an experimental design, we investigated the hypothesis of a trade-off involving brain and muscle at the acute level in humans. Mental performance was measured by a free-recall test, and physical performance by power output on an indoor rowing ergometer. Sixty-two male student rowers performed the two tests in isolation, and then again simultaneously. Paired samples t-tests revealed that both power output and mental performance reduced when tested together compared to in isolation (t(61) = 9.699, p {\textless} 0.001 and t(61) = 8.975, p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, the decrease in physical performance was greater than the decrease in mental performance (t(61) = −2.069, p = 0.043). This is the first investigation to demonstrate an acute level trade-off between these two functions, and provides support for the selfish brain hypothesis due to the relative preservation of cognitive function over physical power output. The underlying mechanism is unclear, and requires further work.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many situations involving animal communication are dominated by recurring, stereotyped signals. How do receivers optimally distinguish between frequently recurring signals and novel ones? Cortical auditory systems are known to be pre-attentively sensitive to short-term delivery statistics of artificial stimuli, but it is unknown if this phenomenon extends to the level of behaviorally relevant delivery patterns, such as those used during communication.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recorded and analyzed complete auditory scenes of spontaneously communicating zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) pairs over a week-long period, and show that they can produce tens of thousands of short-range contact calls per day. Individual calls recur at time scales (median interval 1.5 s) matching those at which mammalian sensory systems are sensitive to recent stimulus history. Next, we presented to anesthetized birds sequences of frequently recurring calls interspersed with rare ones, and recorded, in parallel, action and local field potential responses in the medio-caudal auditory forebrain at 32 unique sites. Variation in call recurrence rate over natural ranges leads to widespread and significant modulation in strength of neural responses. Such modulation is highly call-specific in secondary auditory areas, but not in the main thalamo-recipient, primary auditory area.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support the hypothesis that pre-attentive neural sensitivity to short-term stimulus recurrence is involved in the analysis of auditory scenes at the level of delivery patterns of meaningful sounds. This may enable birds to efficiently and automatically distinguish frequently recurring vocalizations from other events in their auditory scene.},

abstract = {The function of the cerebellum in motor control is a long-standing puzzle because cerebellar damage is associated with both timing and coordination deficits. Timing is the ability to produce consistent intervals between movements based on an internal representation of time. Coordination, in contrast, is a state-dependent control process in which motor commands to one effector depend on the predicted state of another effector. Here we considered a task consisting of two components, an arm movement and an isometric press with the thumb. We found that when the two components temporally overlapped, the brain controlled the thumb using an estimate of the state of the arm. In contrast, when the components did not temporally overlap, the brain controlled the thumb solely based on an internal estimate of time. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we contrasted these two conditions and found that lobule V of the cerebellum ipsilateral to the arm movement was consistently more activated during state-dependent control. When the brain learned time-dependent control, no region of the cerebellum showed consistently increased activity compared with state-dependent control. Rather, the consistent activity associated with time-dependent control was found in language areas of the left cerebral hemisphere along the Sylvian fissure. We suggest that timing and coordination are behaviorally distinct modes of motor control and that the anterior cerebellum is a crucial node in state-dependent motor control, computing a predictive state estimate of one effector (e.g., the arm) to coordinate actions of another effector (the thumb).},

abstract = {The last few years have witnessed a rapid increase in our knowledge of the retinoid-related orphan receptors RORalpha, -beta, and -gamma (NR1F1-3), their mechanism of action, physiological functions, and their potential role in several pathologies. The characterization of ROR-deficient mice and gene expression profiling in particular have provided great insights into the critical functions of RORs in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes. These studies revealed that RORalpha plays a critical role in the development of the cerebellum, that both RORalpha and RORbeta are required for the maturation of photoreceptors in the retina, and that RORgamma is essential for the development of several secondary lymphoid tissues, including lymph nodes. RORs have been further implicated in the regulation of various metabolic pathways, energy homeostasis, and thymopoiesis. Recent studies identified a critical role for RORgamma in lineage specification of uncommitted CD4+ T helper cells into Th17 cells. In addition, RORs regulate the expression of several components of the circadian clock and may play a role in integrating the circadian clock and the rhythmic pattern of expression of downstream (metabolic) genes. Study of ROR target genes has provided insights into the mechanisms by which RORs control these processes. Moreover, several reports have presented evidence for a potential role of RORs in several pathologies, including osteoporosis, several autoimmune diseases, asthma, cancer, and obesity, and raised the possibility that RORs may serve as potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. This prospect was strengthened by recent evidence showing that RORs can function as ligand-dependent transcription factors.},

abstract = {Perception of temporal patterns is fundamental to normal hearing, speech, motor control, and music. Certain types of pattern understanding are unique to humans, such as musical rhythm. Although human responses to musical rhythm are universal, there is much we do not understand about how rhythm is processed in the brain. Here, I consider findings from research into basic timing mechanisms and models through to the neuroscience of rhythm and meter. A network of neural areas, including motor regions, is regularly implicated in basic timing as well as processing of musical rhythm. However, fractionating the specific roles of individual areas in this network has remained a challenge. Distinctions in activity patterns appear between "automatic" and "cognitively controlled" timing processes, but the perception of musical rhythm requires features of both automatic and controlled processes. In addition, many experimental manipulations rely on participants directing their attention toward or away from certain stimulus features, and measuring corresponding differences in neural activity. Many temporal features, however, are implicitly processed whether attended to or not, making it difficult to create controlled baseline conditions for experimental comparisons. The variety of stimuli, paradigms, and definitions can further complicate comparisons across domains or methodologies.

abstract = {The generation of new neurons in the cerebral cortex requires that progenitor cells leave the cell cycle and activate specific programs of differentiation and migration. Genetic studies have identified some of the molecules controlling these cellular events, but how the different aspects of neurogenesis are integrated into a coherent developmental program remains unclear. One possible mechanism implicates multifunctional proteins that regulate, both cell cycle exit and cell differentiation.(1) A prime example is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1), which has recently been shown to function beyond cell cycle regulation and promote both neuronal differentiation and migration of newborn cortical neurons, through distinct and separable mechanisms. p27(Kip1) is therefore part of a machinery that couples the multiple events of neurogenesis in the cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {Our perceptions are shaped by both extrinsic stimuli and intrinsic interpretation. The perceptual experience of a simple rhythm, for example, depends upon its metrical interpretation (where one hears the beat). Such interpretation can be altered at will, providing a model to study the interaction of endogenous and exogenous influences in the cognitive organization of perception. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we measured brain responses evoked by a repeating, rhythmically ambiguous phrase (two tones followed by a rest). In separate trials listeners were instructed to impose different metrical organizations on the rhythm by mentally placing the downbeat on either the first or the second tone. Since the stimulus was invariant, differences in brain activity between the two conditions should relate to endogenous metrical interpretation. Metrical interpretation influenced early evoked neural responses to tones, specifically in the upper beta range (20-30 Hz). Beta response was stronger (by 64{\%} on average) when a tone was imagined to be the beat, compared to when it was not. A second experiment established that the beta increase closely resembles that due to physical accents, and thus may represent the genesis of a subjective accent. The results demonstrate endogenous modulation of early auditory responses, and suggest a unique role for the beta band in linking of endogenous and exogenous processing. Given the suggested role of beta in motor processing and long-range intracortical coordination, it is hypothesized that the motor system influences metrical interpretation of sound, even in the absence of overt movement.},

@article{Sykova2004,
abstract = {Extrasynaptic communication between neurons or neurons and glia is mediated by the diffusion of neuroactive substances in the volume of the extracellular space (ECS). The size and irregular geometry of the diffusion channels in the ECS substantially differ not only around individual cells but also in different CNS regions and thus affect and direct the movement of various neuroactive substances in the ECS. Diffusion in the CNS is therefore not only inhomogeneous, but often also anisotropic. The diffusion parameters in adult mammals (including humans), ECS volume fraction alpha (alpha=ECS volume/total tissue volume) and tortuosity lambda (lambda(2)=free/apparent diffusion coefficient), are typically 0.20-0.25 and 1.5-1.6, respectively, and as such hinder the diffusion of neuroactive substances and water. These diffusion parameters modulate neuronal signaling, neuron-glia communication and extrasynaptic "volume" transmission. A significant decrease in ECS volume fraction and an increase in diffusion barriers (tortuosity) occur during neuronal activity and pathological states. The changes are often related to cell swelling, cell loss, astrogliosis, the rearrangement of neuronal and astrocytic processes and changes in the extracellular matrix. They are also altered during physiological states such as development, lactation and aging. Plastic changes in ECS volume, tortuosity and anisotropy significantly affect neuron-glia communication, the spatial relation of glial processes toward synapses, glutamate or GABA "spillover" and synaptic crosstalk. The various changes in tissue diffusivity occurring during many pathological states are important for diagnosis, drug delivery and treatment.},

abstract = {While not well understood, the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonist ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, has been reported to be efficacious in depression and related psychological disorders. Conditioned fear is a normal emotional conditioning process that is known to become dysfunctional in individuals suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and related stress disorders. We examined the effects of ketamine to determine the potential modulation of the acquisition and extinction of a conditioned fear using a conditioned suppression procedure. Rats were trained on a variable interval (VI), food maintained, operant conditioning task to establish a general measure of performance. Rats were exposed to inescapable shock (IES, unconditioned stimulus) paired ({\"{i}}¿½ 20) with an audio/visual conditioned stimulus (CS) to establish conditioning. Conditioning was quantified by measuring response suppression following CS presentation during subsequent extinction trials where the CS alone was presented. Ketamine or vehicle was administered either after initial conditioning or after each of the subsequent extinction trials. For each regimen, a series of four injections were administered 60 min apart (100, 50, 50, 50 mg/kg, respectively) in order to sustain a ketamine effect for a minimum of 4 h. Ketamine produced a general decrease in responding on the VI, relative to baseline, as response rates were slower on the operant task when tested 24 h later and longer. Ketamine did not affect the acquisition of the conditioned fear when the regimen was administered shortly after the initial pairings of IES and CS. Ketamine did not alter extinction to the conditioned fear when the regimen was administered following each CS only presentation following initial conditioning. Our conclusion from these findings is that while ketamine alters behavior on an appetitively motivated operant task it does not, however, appear to directly modulate learning and memory processes associated with conditioned fear.},

abstract = {Differences between the geometrical properties of simple configurations and their visual percept are called geometrical-optical illusions. They can be differentiated from illusions in the brightness or color domains, from ambiguous figures and impossible objects, from trompe l'oeil and perspective drawing with perfectly valid views, and from illusory contours. They were discovered independently by several scientists in a short time span in the 1850's. The clear distinction between object and visual space that they imply allows the question to be raised whether the transformation between the two spaces can be productively investigated in terms of differential geometry and metrical properties. Perceptual insight and psychophysical research prepares the ground for investigation of the neural representation of space but, because visual attributes are processed separately in parallel, one looks in vain for a neural map that is isomorphic with object space or even with individual forms it contains. Geometrical-optical illusions help reveal parsing rules for sensory signals by showing how conflicts are resolved when there is mismatch in the output of the processing modules for various primitives as a perceptual pattern's unitary structure is assembled. They point to a hierarchical ordering of spatial primitives: cardinal directions and explicit contours predominate over oblique orientation and implicit contours (Poggendorff illusion); rectilinearity yields to continuity (Hering illusion), point position and line length to contour orientation (Ponzo). Hence the geometrical-optical illusions show promise as analytical tools in unraveling neural processing in vision.},

@article{Thompson2010,
abstract = {Learning typically increases the strength of responses and the number of neurons that respond to training stimuli. Few studies have explored representational plasticity using natural stimuli, however, leaving unknown the changes that accompany learning under more realistic conditions. Here, we examine experience-dependent plasticity in European starlings, a songbird with rich acoustic communication signals tied to robust, natural recognition behaviors. We trained starlings to recognize conspecific songs and recorded the extracellular spiking activity of single neurons in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), a secondary auditory forebrain region analogous to mammalian auditory cortex. Training induced a stimulus-specific weakening of the neural responses (lower spike rates) to the learned songs, whereas the population continued to respond robustly to unfamiliar songs. Additional experiments rule out stimulus-specific adaptation and general biases for novel stimuli as explanations of these effects. Instead, the results indicate that associative learning leads to single neuron responses in which both irrelevant and unfamiliar stimuli elicit more robust responses than behaviorally relevant natural stimuli. Detailed analyses of these effects at a finer temporal scale point to changes in the number of motifs eliciting excitatory responses above a neuron's spontaneous discharge rate. These results show a novel form of experience-dependent plasticity in the auditory forebrain that is tied to associative learning and in which the overall strength of responses is inversely related to learned behavioral significance.},

abstract = {We investigated the participation of genomic regulatory events in the response of the songbird brain to a natural auditory stimulus of known physiological and behavioral relevance, birdsong. Using in situ hybridization, we detected a rapid increase in forebrain mRNA levels of an immediate-early gene encoding a transcriptional regulator (ZENK; also known as zif-268, egr-1, NGFI-A, or Krox-24) following presentation of tape-recorded songs to canaries (Serinus canaria) and zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). ZENK induction is most marked in a forebrain region believed to participate in auditory processing and is greatest when birds hear the song of their own species. A significantly lower level of induction occurs when birds hear the song of a different species and no induction is seen after exposure to tone bursts. Cellular analysis indicates that the level of induction reflects the proportion of neurons recruited to express the gene. These results suggest a role for genomic responses in neural processes linked to song pattern recognition, discrimination, or the formation of auditory associations.},

Higa's (see record 1999-13592-007) argument that scalar expectancy theory fails to explain some basic properties of operant behavior on interval-timing procedures, and on their proposal of an alternative theory derived from the multiple-time-scale model of habituation. To explain time-scale invariant distributions of response latencies, it appears necessary to postulate scalar noise in the remembered intervals, against which the subjective measure of the currently elapsing interval is compared. At least in some cases, the observed variability cannot be due to variability in the subjective intervals written to memory; it must come from noise (variability) in the reading of a memory. Staddon and Higa's proposal offers no explanation for the observed variability, and it is unclear what noise assumption would yield the observed variability, given their assumption that intervals are timed by a nonlinear decay process. The decay process cannot plausibly be represented by the logarithmic function, because it begins and ends at infinity. The assumption of any form of nonlinear timing is inconsistent with the most important result of the time-left experiment, i.e., that the changeover time increases linearly with the comparison-standard difference.

abstract = {Vocal learning is a critical behavioral substrate for spoken human language. It is a rare trait found in three distantly related groups of birds-songbirds, hummingbirds, and parrots. These avian groups have remarkably similar systems of cerebral vocal nuclei for the control of learned vocalizations that are not found in their more closely related vocal non-learning relatives. These findings led to the hypothesis that brain pathways for vocal learning in different groups evolved independently from a common ancestor but under pre-existing constraints. Here, we suggest one constraint, a pre-existing system for movement control. Using behavioral molecular mapping, we discovered that in songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds, all cerebral vocal learning nuclei are adjacent to discrete brain areas active during limb and body movements. Similar to the relationships between vocal nuclei activation and singing, activation in the adjacent areas correlated with the amount of movement performed and was independent of auditory and visual input. These same movement-associated brain areas were also present in female songbirds that do not learn vocalizations and have atrophied cerebral vocal nuclei, and in ring doves that are vocal non-learners and do not have cerebral vocal nuclei. A compilation of previous neural tracing experiments in songbirds suggests that the movement-associated areas are connected in a network that is in parallel with the adjacent vocal learning system. This study is the first global mapping that we are aware for movement-associated areas of the avian cerebrum and it indicates that brain systems that control vocal learning in distantly related birds are directly adjacent to brain systems involved in movement control. Based upon these findings, we propose a motor theory for the origin of vocal learning, this being that the brain areas specialized for vocal learning in vocal learners evolved as a specialization of a pre-existing motor pathway that controls movement.},

abstract = {Male and female brains differ in both structure and function. Investigating this sexual dimorphism in healthy subjects is an important first step to ultimately gain insight into sex-specific differences in behavior and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. The basal ganglia are among the main regions containing sex steroid receptors in the brain and play a central role in cognitive (dys)functioning. However, little is known about sexual dimorphism of different basal ganglia nuclei. The aim of the present study was to investigate sex-specific differences in basal ganglia morphology using MRI. We applied automatic volumetry on anatomical MRI data of two large cohorts of healthy young adults (n = 463 and n = 541) and assessed the volume of four major nuclei of the basal ganglia: caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, and putamen, while controlling for total gray matter volume, total white matter volume, and age of the participant. No significant sex differences were found for caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens, but males showed significantly larger volumes for globus pallidus and putamen, as confirmed in both cohorts. These results show that sexual dimorphism is neither a general effect in the basal ganglia nor confined to just one specific nucleus, and will aid the interpretation of differences in basal ganglia (dys)function between males and females.

abstract = {According to the enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF) model, autistic perception is characterized by: enhanced low-level operations; locally oriented processing as a default setting; greater activation of perceptual areas during a range of visuospatial, language, working memory or reasoning tasks; autonomy towards higher processes; and superior involvement in intelligence. EPF has been useful in accounting for autistic relative peaks of ability in the visual and auditory modalities. However, the role played by atypical perceptual mechanisms in the emergence and character of savant abilities remains underdeveloped. We now propose that enhanced detection of patterns, including similarity within and among patterns, is one of the mechanisms responsible for operations on human codes, a type of material with which savants show particular facility. This mechanism would favour an orientation towards material possessing the highest level of internal structure, through the implicit detection of within- and between-code isomorphisms. A second mechanism, related to but exceeding the existing concept of redintegration, involves completion, or filling-in, of missing information in memorized or perceived units or structures. In the context of autistics' enhanced perception, the nature and extent of these two mechanisms, and their possible contribution to the creativity evident in savant performance, are explored.},

abstract = {The adult cerebellum is organized into longitudinal compartments that are revealed by specific axonal projections (olivocerebellar and corticonuclear projections). These compartments in the adult cerebellum are closely correlated with the striped expression of zebrin II (aldolase C), a late-onset marker of Purkinje cells. Similarly, the embryonic cerebellum is organized into longitudinal compartments that are revealed by striped expression of other genes (early-onset markers). The cerebellar compartments are thought to be the basic and functional subdivisions of the cerebellum. However, the relationship between the embryonic (early-onset) and the adult (late-onset) compartments has remained unknown, because the pattern of the embryonic compartments is distinct from that of the adult compartments. To examine this issue, we labeled Purkinje cells (PCs) born at embryonic day (E) 10.5, E11.5, and E12.5 by using an adenoviral vector and traced their fated positions in the adult cerebellum. By comparing the striped distribution of each cohort of birth date-related PCs with the striped pattern of zebrin II immunoreactivity (zebrin II bands) in the entire adult cerebellum, we found that the striped distribution of PCs correlated strikingly with zebrin II bands. Generally, a single early-onset compartment was transformed directly into a single late-onset compartment. Therefore, our observation also indicated the close correlation between the compartments formed by birth date-related PCs and olivocerebellar projections. Furthermore, we found that the cerebellum was composed of three units showing lateral-to-medial developmental gradients, as revealed by the birth dates of PCs. The results suggest that PC birth dates play an important role in organizing cerebellar compartmentalization.},

abstract = {Persistent activation of GABAA receptors by extracellular GABA (tonic inhibition) plays a critical role in signal processing and network excitability in the brain. In hippocampal principal cells, tonic inhibition has been reported to be mediated by alpha5-subunit-containing GABAA receptors (alpha5GABAARs). Pharmacological or genetic disruption of these receptors improves cognitive performance, suggesting that tonic inhibition has an adverse effect on information processing. Here, we show that alpha5GABAARs contribute to tonic currents in pyramidal cells only when ambient GABA concentrations increase (as may occur during increased brain activity). At low ambient GABA concentrations, activation of delta-subunit-containing GABAA receptors predominates. In epileptic tissue, alpha5GABAARs are downregulated and no longer contribute to tonic currents under conditions of raised extracellular GABA concentrations. Under these conditions, however, the tonic current is greater in pyramidal cells from epileptic tissue than in pyramidal cells from nonepileptic tissue, implying substitution of alpha5GABAARs by other GABAA receptor subtypes. These results reveal multiple components of tonic GABAA receptor-mediated conductance that are activated by low GABA concentrations. The relative contribution of these components changes after the induction of epilepsy, implying an adaptive plasticity of the tonic current in the presence of spontaneous seizures.},

abstract = {The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and the Mander's overlap coefficient (MOC) are used to quantify the degree of colocalization between fluorophores. The MOC was introduced to overcome perceived problems with the PCC. The two coefficients are mathematically similar, differing in the use of either the absolute intensities (MOC) or of the deviation from the mean (PCC). A range of correlated datasets, which extend to the limits of the PCC, only evoked a limited response from the MOC. The PCC is unaffected by changes to the offset while the MOC increases when the offset is positive. Both coefficients are independent of gain. The MOC is a confusing hybrid measurement, that combines correlation with a heavily weighted form of co-occurrence, favors high intensity combinations, downplays combinations in which either or both intensities are low and ignores blank pixels. The PCC only measures correlation. A surprising finding was that the addition of a second uncorrelated population can substantially increase the measured correlation, demonstrating the importance of excluding background pixels. Overall, since the MOC is unresponsive to substantial changes in the data and is hard to interpret, it is neither an alternative to nor a useful substitute for the PCC. The MOC is not suitable for making measurements of colocalization either by correlation or co-occurrence.},

Analyzing and characterizing this structure poses significant signal processing challenges. In the context of birdsong development, we have previously proposed that an effective way to do this is to use the dynamic spectrum or spectrogram, a classical signal processing tool, computed at multiple time scales in a nested fashion. Temporal structure on the millisecond timescale is normally captured using a short time Fourier analysis, and structure on the second timescale using song spectrograms. Here we use the dynamic spectrum on time series of song features to study the development of rhythm in juvenile zebra finch. The method is able to detect rhythmic structure in juvenile song in contrast to previous characterizations of such song as unstructured. We show that the method can be used to examine song development, the accuracy with which rhythm is imitated, and the variability of rhythms across different renditions of a song. We hope that this technique will provide a standard, automated method for measuring and characterizing song rhythm.},

On- and off-beam inhibition has been assumed to be spatially uniform and continuous within a folium. Using flavoprotein autofluorescence optical imaging in the mouse cerebellar cortex in vivo, this study demonstrates that the inhibition evoked by parallel fiber and peripheral stimulation results in parasagittal bands of decreases in fluorescence that correspond to zebrin II-positive bands. The parasagittal bands of decreased fluorescence are abolished by GABA(A) antagonists and reflect the activity of molecular layer interneurons on their targets. The same banding pattern was observed using Ca2+ imaging. The bands produce spatially specific decreases in the responses to peripheral input. Therefore, molecular layer inhibition is compartmentalized into zebrin II parasagittal domains that differentially modulate the spatial pattern of cerebellar cortical activity.},

abstract = {Dystonia is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive involuntary muscle contractions that lead to twisting movements or abnormal posturing. Traditional views place responsibility for dystonia with dysfunction of basal ganglia circuits, yet recent evidence has pointed towards cerebellar circuits as well. In the current studies we used two strategies to explore the hypothesis that the expression of dystonic movements depends on influences from a motor network that includes both the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The first strategy was to evaluate the consequences of subthreshold lesions of the striatum in two different animal models where dystonic movements are thought to originate from abnormal cerebellar function. The second strategy employed microdialysis to search for changes in striatal dopamine release in these two animal models where the cerebellum has been already implicated. One of the animal models involved tottering mice, which exhibit paroxysmal dystonia due to an inherited defect affecting calcium channels. In keeping with prior results implicating the cerebellum in this model, surgical removal of the cerebellum eliminated their dystonic attacks. In contrast, subclinical lesions of the striatum with either 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) or quinolinic acid (QA) exaggerated their dystonic attacks. Microdialysis of the striatum revealed dystonic attacks in tottering mice to be associated with a significant reduction in extracellular striatal dopamine. The other animal model involved the induction of dystonia via pharmacological excitation of the cerebellar cortex by local application of kainic acid in normal mice. In this model the site of stimulation determines the origin of dystonia in the cerebellum. However, subclinical striatal lesions with either 6OHDA or QA again exaggerated their generalized dystonia. When dystonic movements were triggered by pharmacological stimulation of the cerebellum, microdialysis revealed significant reductions in striatal dopamine release. These results demonstrate important functional relationships between cerebellar and basal ganglia circuits in two different animal models of dystonia. They suggest that expression of dystonic movements depends on influences from both basal ganglia and cerebellum in both models. These results support the hypothesis that dystonia may result from disruption of a motor network involving both the basal ganglia and cerebellum, rather than isolated dysfunction of only one motor system.},

abstract = {Little is known about the underlying neurobiology of rhythm and beat perception, despite its universal cultural importance. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study rhythm perception in musicians and nonmusicians. Three conditions varied in the degree to which external reinforcement versus internal generation of the beat was required. The "volume" condition strongly externally marked the beat with volume changes, the "duration" condition marked the beat with weaker accents arising from duration changes, and the "unaccented" condition required the beat to be entirely internally generated. In all conditions, beat rhythms compared with nonbeat control rhythms revealed putamen activity. The presence of a beat was also associated with greater connectivity between the putamen and the supplementary motor area (SMA), the premotor cortex (PMC), and auditory cortex. In contrast, the type of accent within the beat conditions modulated the coupling between premotor and auditory cortex, with greater modulation for musicians than nonmusicians. Importantly, the response of the putamen to beat conditions was not attributable to differences in temporal complexity between the three rhythm conditions. We propose that a cortico-subcortical network including the putamen, SMA, and PMC is engaged for the analysis of temporal sequences and prediction or generation of putative beats, especially under conditions that may require internal generation of the beat. The importance of this system for auditory-motor interaction and development of precisely timed movement is suggested here by its facilitation in musicians.},

This prediction is confirmed in two experiments in which subjects moved a hand to one side of the field on presentation of a go stimulus. Although the direction of movement was known in advance and the spatial attribute of the go stimuli was irrelevant to the go-no-go decision, the subjects' response time was shorter when the spatial attribute to the go stimulus corresponded to that of the response than when it did not. These effects are shown to depend on the similarity of the go and the no-go stimuli, as well as on whether the spatial attribute of the go stimuli was its actual location or its meaning. We discuss these results in terms of the temporal dynamics of automatic and controlled response processes, as hypothesized in the DO model.},

Step-through type inhibitory avoidance task was used to test memory retrieval. Post-training administration of morphine (5 and 7.5 mg/kg) induced amnesia. The response induced by post-training morphine was significantly reversed by pre-test administration of the drug. Pre-test injection of nicotine (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg s.c.) alone and nicotine (0.1, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg s.c.) plus an ineffective dose of morphine also significantly reversed the amnesia induced by morphine. Morphine amnesia was also prevented by pre-test administration of l-arginine (1 and 3 $\mu$g/rat, intra-VTA), a nitric oxide (NO) precursor. Interestingly, an ineffective dose of nicotine (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) in combination with low dose of l-arginine (0.3 $\mu$g/rat, intra-VTA) synergistically improved memory performance impaired by morphine given after training. In contrast, pre-test administration of NG nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (2 $\mu$g/rat, intra-VTA) prevented the nicotine reversal of morphine effect on memory. The results suggest a possible role for nitric oxide of ventral tegmental area in the improving effect of nicotine on the morphine-induced amnesia.},

abstract = {Although brain imaging studies have demonstrated that listening to music alters human brain structure and function, the molecular mechanisms mediating those effects remain unknown. With the advent of genomics and bioinformatics approaches, these effects of music can now be studied in a more detailed fashion. To verify whether listening to classical music has any effect on human transcriptome, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling from the peripheral blood of participants after listening to classical music (n = 48), and after a control study without music exposure (n = 15). As musical experience is known to influence the responses to music, we compared the transcriptional responses of musically experienced and inexperienced participants separately with those of the controls. Comparisons were made based on two subphenotypes of musical experience: musical aptitude and music education. In musically experiencd participants, we observed the differential expression of 45 genes (27 up- and 18 down-regulated) and 97 genes (75 up- and 22 down-regulated) respectively based on subphenotype comparisons (rank product non-parametric statistics, pfp 0.05, {\textgreater}1.2-fold change over time across conditions). Gene ontological overrepresentation analysis (hypergeometric test, FDR {\textless} 0.05) revealed that the up-regulated genes are primarily known to be involved in the secretion and transport of dopamine, neuron projection, protein sumoylation, long-term potentiation and dephosphorylation. Down-regulated genes are known to be involved in ATP synthase-coupled proton transport, cytolysis, and positive regulation of caspase, peptidase and endopeptidase activities. One of the most up-regulated genes, alpha-synuclein (SNCA), is located in the best linkage region of musical aptitude on chromosome 4q22.1 and is regulated by GATA2, which is known to be associated with musical aptitude. Several genes reported to regulate song perception and production in songbirds displayed altered activities, suggesting a possible evolutionary conservation of sound perception between species. We observed no significant findings in musically inexperienced participants.},

abstract = {In the auditory cortex of awake animals, a substantial number of neurons do not respond to pure tones. These neurons have historically been classified as "unresponsive" and even been speculated as being nonauditory. We discovered, however, that many of these neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake marmoset monkeys were in fact highly selective for complex sound features. We then investigated how such selectivity might arise from the tone-tuned inputs that these neurons likely receive. We found that these non-tone responsive neurons exhibited nonlinear combination-sensitive responses that require precise spectral and temporal combinations of two tone pips. The nonlinear spectrotemporal maps derived from these neurons were correlated with their selectivity for complex acoustic features. These non-tone responsive and nonlinear neurons were commonly encountered at superficial cortical depths in A1. Our findings demonstrate how temporally and spectrally specific nonlinear integration of putative tone-tuned inputs might underlie a diverse range of high selectivity of A1 neurons in awake animals. We propose that describing A1 neurons with complex response properties in terms of tone-tuned input channels can conceptually unify a wide variety of observed neural selectivity to complex sounds into a lower dimensional description.},

Here we tested the hypothesis that the brain uses differential timing mechanisms and networks--specifically, that the cerebellum subserves the perception of the absolute duration of time intervals, whereas the basal ganglia mediate perception of time intervals relative to a regular beat. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, we asked human subjects to judge the difference in duration of two successive time intervals as a function of the preceding context of an irregular sequence of clicks (where the task relies on encoding the absolute duration of time intervals) or a regular sequence of clicks (where the regular beat provides an extra cue for relative timing). We found significant activations in an olivocerebellar network comprising the inferior olive, vermis, and deep cerebellar nuclei including the dentate nucleus during absolute, duration-based timing and a striato-thalamo-cortical network comprising the putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during relative, beat-based timing. Our results support two distinct timing mechanisms and underlying subsystems: first, a network comprising the inferior olive and the cerebellum that acts as a precision clock to mediate absolute, duration-based timing, and second, a distinct network for relative, beat-based timing incorporating a striato-thalamo-cortical network.},

When juvenile songbirds learn their songs from a tutor, they form and alter a central representation of the tutor song, known as the 'template'. Secondary auditory regions in the caudal medial pallium are likely to contain the neural substrate for the representation of tutor song, but the roles of the different regions remain to be elucidated. Female zebra finches do not sing, but nevertheless form an auditory memory of their father's song, for which the neural substrate is located in the caudomedial pallium. In males that are learning their songs, there is continual interaction between the secondary auditory regions and sensorimotor regions, similar to the interaction between Broca's and Wernicke's areas in human infants acquiring speech and language.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological and activity-dependent gene expression studies of birdsong have contributed to the understanding of the neural representation of natural sounds. However, we have limited knowledge about the overall spatial topography of song representation in the avian brain. Here, we adapt the noninvasive functional MRI method in mildly sedated zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to localize and characterize song driven brain activation. Based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal, we observed a differential topographic responsiveness to playback of bird's own song, tutor song, conspecific song, and a pure tone as a nonsong stimulus. The bird's own song caused a stronger response than the tutor song or tone in higher auditory areas. This effect was more pronounced in the medial parts of the forebrain. We found left-right hemispheric asymmetry in sensory responses to songs, with significant discrimination between stimuli observed only in the right hemisphere. This finding suggests that perceptual responses might be lateralized in zebra finches. In addition to establishing the feasibility of functional MRI in sedated songbirds, our results demonstrate spatial coding of song in the zebra finch forebrain, based on developmental familiarity and experience.},

abstract = {Humans are able to find and tap to the beat of musical rhythms varying in complexity from children's songs to modern jazz. Musical beat has no one-to-one relationship with auditory features-it is an abstract perceptual representation that emerges from the interaction between sensory cues and higher-level cognitive organization. Previous investigations have examined the neural basis of beat processing but have not tested the core phenomenon of finding and tapping to the musical beat. To test this, we used fMRI and had musicians find and tap to the beat of rhythms that varied from metrically simple to metrically complex-thus from a strong to a weak beat. Unlike most previous studies, we measured beat tapping performance during scanning and controlled for possible effects of scanner noise on beat perception. Results showed that beat finding and tapping recruited largely overlapping brain regions, including the superior temporal gyrus (STG), premotor cortex, and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC). Beat tapping activity in STG and VLPFC was correlated with both perception and performance, suggesting that they are important for retrieving, selecting, and maintaining the musical beat. In contrast BG activity was similar in all conditions and was not correlated with either perception or production, suggesting that it may be involved in detecting auditory temporal regularity or in associating auditory stimuli with a motor response. Importantly, functional connectivity analyses showed that these systems interact, indicating that more basic sensorimotor mechanisms instantiated in the BG work in tandem with higher-order cognitive mechanisms in PFC.},

abstract = {Standard measures of phonemic and semantic fluency, as well as fluency measures that impose additional demands upon set-switching were administered to younger and older adults. No age effect was found for total output on semantic fluency, while older participants generated significantly more responses relative to their younger counterparts on the phonemic measure. However, older adults made significantly more perseverative errors on both these measures. For tests of alternating fluency, only where participants were required to switch between two semantic dimensions, was an age deficit observed. Although the correlation between phonemic repetitions and age remained significant when performance on the Digit Symbol Test or a measure of fluid intelligence was partialled out, age effects for semantic repetitions and semantic alternating fluency were substantially reduced. The age benefit for number of correct responses upon phonemic fluency was significantly attenuated when a measure of crystallized intelligence was entered as a control variable. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.},

abstract = {Hebbian models of development and learning require both activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and a mechanism that induces competition between different synapses. One form of experimentally observed long-term synaptic plasticity, which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},

@article{Rasmussen2008,
abstract = {Classical blink conditioning is known to depend critically on the cerebellum and the relevant circuitry is gradually being unravelled. Several lines of evidence support the theory that the conditioned stimulus is transmitted by mossy fibers to the cerebellar cortex whereas the unconditioned stimulus is transmitted by climbing fibers. This view has been dramatically confirmed by recent Purkinje cell recordings during training with a classical conditioning paradigm. We have tracked the activity of single Purkinje cells with microelectrodes for several hours in decerebrate ferrets during learning, extinction, and relearning. Paired peripheral forelimb and periocular stimulation, as well as paired direct stimulation of cerebellar afferent pathways (mossy and climbing fibers) causes acquisition of a pause response in Purkinje cell simple spike firing. This conditioned Purkinje cell response has temporal properties that match those of the behavioral response. Its latency varies with the interstimulus interval and it responds to manipulations of the conditioned stimulus in the same way that the blink does. Complex spike firing largely mirrors the simple spike behavior. We have previously suggested that cerebellar learning is subject to a negative feedback control via the inhibitory nucleo-olivary pathway. As the Purkinje cell learns to respond to the conditioned stimulus with a suppression of simple spikes, disinhibition of anterior interpositus neurons would be expected to cause inhibition of the inferior olive. Observations of complex spike firing in the Purkinje cells during conditioning and extinction confirm this prediction. Before training, complex spikes are unaffected or facilitated by the conditioned stimulus, but as the simple spike pause response develops, spontaneous and stimulus-evoked complex spikes are also strongly suppressed by the conditioned stimulus. After extinction of the simple spike pause response, the complex spikes reappear.},

The abnormal sleep that is experienced by these patients is largely assumed to be the product of medication or some other influence that is not well defined. However, normal brain function and the generation of sleep are linked by common neurotransmitter systems and regulatory pathways. Disruption of sleep alters sleep-wake timing, destabilizes physiology and promotes a range of pathologies (from cognitive to metabolic defects) that are rarely considered to be associated with abnormal sleep. We propose that brain disorders and abnormal sleep have a common mechanistic origin and that many co-morbid pathologies that are found in brain disease arise from a destabilization of sleep mechanisms. The stabilization of sleep may be a means by which to reduce the symptoms of--and permit early intervention of--psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease.},

We tested the hypothesis that listeners demonstrate different patterns of activation associated with music processing-particularly right frontal cortex-when encoding and retrieving culturally familiar and unfamiliar stimuli, with the latter evoking broader activation consistent with more complex memory tasks. Subjects (n = 16) were right-handed adults born and raised in the USA (n = 8) or Turkey (n = 8) with minimal music training. Using fMRI procedures, we scanned subjects during two tasks: (i) listening to novel musical examples from their own culture and an unfamiliar culture and (ii) identifying which among a series of brief excerpts were taken from the longer examples. Both groups were more successful remembering music of their home culture. We found greater activation for culturally unfamiliar music listening in the left cerebellar region, right angular gyrus, posterior precuneus and right middle frontal area extending into the inferior frontal cortex. Subjects demonstrated greater activation in the cingulate gyrus and right lingual gyrus when engaged in recall of culturally unfamiliar music. This study provides evidence for the influence of culture on music perception and memory performance at both a behavioral and neurological level.},

abstract = {Song development research has been dominated by studies of northern hemisphere species where typically only males sing. However, female song is present in many species and recent research shows that female song is in fact the ancestral trait for songbirds. Here we present results from a field-based cross-sectional study comparing song development in both sexes of New Zealand bellbirds, Anthornis melanura. We asked whether both sexes develop song at a similar rate, and how the components of a song differ with age. The motor phases of each sex began at similar ages, with subsong starting at 3 weeks posthatching and song types crystallizing by 24 weeks. Song components were compared between three age groups: learning phase, first breeding season and adults. Song structure and acoustic properties were similar between sexes within the learning phase (except for mean fundamental frequency) but differed in adults. The variety of syllable types produced was more widespread in the learning phase and differed significantly between age groups and sexes. Individual syllable production varied in consistency between age groups for both sexes and we suggest that more complex syllables may require more practice to develop to maturity. The findings support the consensus that female and male bellbirds learn song at similar rates; however, differences between the sexes in the learned song components result in sexually dimorphic songs. This study is novel in that we used a field-based approach in which the complex song of male and female wild birds was compared between age groups ranging from fledging to adulthood. Our study contributes to current knowledge of female song development, a topic important for further understanding the selection pressures driving song evolution in songbirds.},

Increasingly refined expression strategies based on transcriptional modulators and site-specific recombinases are used to distribute markers or combinations of markers within specific neuronal subsets. Several trends are emerging: first, increasing labelling density with multiplexed markers to allow more cells to be reliably distinguished; second, using labels to report lineage relationships among defined cells in addition to anatomy; third, coupling cell labelling with genetic manipulations that reveal or perturb cell function. These strategies offer new opportunities for characterizing the fine scale architecture of neuronal circuits, and understanding lineage and functional relations among their cellular components in normal or experimental situations.},

@article{Woolley2008,
abstract = {Social cues modulate the performance of communicative behaviors in a range of species, including humans, and such changes can make the communication signal more salient. In songbirds, males use song to attract females, and song organization can differ depending on the audience to which a male sings. For example, male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) change their songs in subtle ways when singing to a female (directed song) compared with when they sing in isolation (undirected song), and some of these changes depend on altered neural activity from a specialized forebrain-basal ganglia circuit, the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). In particular, variable activity in the AFP during undirected song is thought to actively enable syllable variability, whereas the lower and less-variable AFP firing during directed singing is associated with more stereotyped song. Consequently, directed song has been suggested to reflect a "performance" state, and undirected song a form of vocal motor "exploration." However, this hypothesis predicts that directed-undirected song differences, despite their subtlety, should matter to female zebra finches, which is a question that has not been investigated. We tested female preferences for this natural variation in song in a behavioral approach assay, and we found that both mated and socially naive females could discriminate between directed and undirected song-and strongly preferred directed song. These preferences, which appeared to reflect attention especially to aspects of song variability controlled by the AFP, were enhanced by experience, as they were strongest for mated females responding to their mate's directed songs. We then measured neural activity using expression of the immediate early gene product ZENK, and found that social context and song familiarity differentially modulated the number of ZENK-expressing cells in telencephalic auditory areas. Specifically, the number of ZENK-expressing cells in the caudomedial mesopallium (CMM) was most affected by whether a song was directed or undirected, whereas the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) was most affected by whether a song was familiar or unfamiliar. Together these data demonstrate that females detect and prefer the features of directed song and suggest that high-level auditory areas including the CMM are involved in this social perception.},

abstract = {Although the overall topography of the cerebellar corticonuclear projection formed by Purkinje cell (PC) axons has been described, only a few studies have dealt with the organization of this projection at the level of individual PC axons. Thus, we reconstructed 65 single PC axons that were labeled with biotinylated dextran amine in the rat. We then analyzed the relationship between the projections of these PCs and the compartmentalization of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei based on the topography of olivocerebellar projection and aldolase C expression in PCs. After giving rise to short local recurrent collaterals near the soma, a PC axon formed a terminal arbor in a specific small area in the cerebellar nuclei (CN). The terminal arbors of vermal PCs were spread more widely than those of hemispheric PCs and sometimes extended to extracerebellar targets. PCs located in any of the aldolase C-positive (Groups I and II) and -negative (Groups III and IV) stripes consistently projected to the caudoventral and rostrodorsal parts of the CN, respectively, precisely in accordance with the compartmentalization of the cortex and nuclei. Mediolateral segregation and rostrocaudal convergence were seen between projections of separate PCs in a single aldolase C compartment. The results revealed a tight link between the projection patterns of individual PC axons, the topography of the olivocerebellar pathway, and the aldolase C expression pattern. Their overall correspondence seems to reflect a basic aspect of cerebellar organization, although some area-dependent variation in the relationship of these three entities was also present.},

abstract = {Objective: In order to understand better the psychophysiological basis of auditory processing abnormalities in autism, we decided to study two automatic components of the auditory event-related potentials (ERPs): the mismatch negativity (MMN) - a component of the ERP which is recorded when, during repetitive auditory stimulation, rare changes are introduced - and the novelty-related P3a which is recorded as a response to unexpected novel events occurring in a sequence of repetitive stimuli. Methods: Ten male subjects, mean age 12.3 years (SD 4.95), affected by autism and mental retardation were admitted to this study. All patients were also mentally retarded. Ten normal male subjects, mean age 12.2 years (SD 3.94), were used as controls. Auditory evoked potentials were recorded from 19 scalp electrodes (10-20 system), and stimuli were presented in sequences consisting of 2000 tones (70dB, ISI=800ms). Three types of stimuli were presented: (1) standard stimuli (1000 Hz tones, 80{\%} of total stimuli), (2) deviant stimuli (1300 Hz tones, 10{\%} of total stimuli), and (3) novel stimuli (complex and non-monotonal, 10{\%} of total stimuli). To quantify the MMN, the evoked response to the standard tones was subtracted from the corresponding deviant stimulus response and its amplitude and latency at peak were measured over Fz, Cz and Pz; similarly, the P3a component of the ERP was obtained by subtracting the response to the standard tone from that to the novel stimuli and its amplitude and latency at peak were measured over Fz, Cz and Pz. Also, the amplitude and latency at peak for the N1 component of the auditory evoked potential obtained with the standard stimuli were measured over Fz, Cz and Pz. The correlation between age and MMN and P3a amplitude was also analyzed. Results: N1 showed significantly shorter latencies in the autistic groups. MMN elicited by deviant stimuli, but not that elicited by novel stimuli, was found to be significantly larger in autistic children than in normal controls. P3a showed higher amplitude in autistic subjects than in normal controls during childhood; the opposite was observed during young adulthood. Discussion: Our findings indicate that significant changes in ERPs can also be seen in non-cooperative individuals with autism and mental retardation, which might be different from the changes already reported for high-functioning autistic subjects and deserve further insight. These changes show developmental modifications that should be taken into consideration when analyzing data from autistic subjects. ?? 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {Sex steroids facilitate dramatic changes in behavioral responses to sociosexual signals and are increasingly implicated in the sensory processing of those signals. Our previous work demonstrated that in female white-throated sparrows, which are seasonal breeders, genomic responses in the auditory forebrain are selective for conspecific song over frequency-matched tones only when plasma estradiol (E2) reaches breeding levels. Here, we sought to map this E2-dependent selectivity in the best-studied area of the auditory forebrain, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). Nonbreeding females with low endogenous levels of E2 were treated with E2 or a placebo and exposed to conspecific song, tones, or no sound playback. Immunoreactive protein product of the immediate early gene zenk (egr-1) was then quantified within seven distinct subregions, or domains, of NCM. We report three main findings: (1) regardless of hormone treatment, the zenk response is significantly higher in dorsal than in ventral NCM, and higher in medial than in lateral NCM; (2) E2-dependent selectivity of the response is limited to the rostral and medial domains of NCM; in the more caudal domains, song induces more zenk expression than tones regardless of hormone treatment; (3) even when no sound stimuli were presented, E2 treatment significantly increased zenk expression in the rostral, but not the caudal, domains of NCM. Together, the latter two findings suggest that E2-dependent plasticity in NCM is concentrated in rostral NCM, which is hodologically and neurochemically distinct from caudal NCM. Activity in rostral NCM may therefore be seasonally regulated in this species.},

abstract = {Synchronizing movements with auditory beats, compared to visual flashes, yields divergent activation in timing-related brain areas as well as more stable tapping synchronization. The differences in timing-related brain activation could reflect differences in tapping synchronization stability, rather than differences between modality (i.e., audio-motor vs. visuo-motor integration). In the current fMRI study, participants synchronized their finger taps with four types of visual and auditory pacing sequences: flashes and a moving bar, as well as beeps and a frequency-modulated 'siren'. Behavioral tapping results showed that visuo-motor synchronization improved with moving targets, whereas audio-motor synchronization degraded with frequency-modulated sirens. Consequently, a modality difference in synchronization occurred between the discrete beeps and flashes, but not between the novel continuous siren and moving bar. Imaging results showed that activation in the putamen, a key timing area, paralleled the behavioral results: putamen activation was highest for beeps, intermediate for the continuous siren and moving bar, and was lowest for the flashes. Putamen activation differed between modalities for beeps and flashes, but not for the novel moving bar and siren. By dissociating synchronization performance from modality, we show that activation in the basal ganglia is associated with sensorimotor synchronization stability rather than modality-specificity in this task. Synchronization stability is apparently contingent upon the modality's processing affinity: discrete auditory and moving visual signals are modality appropriate, and can be encoded reliably for integration with the motor system.},

abstract = {Temporal orienting of attention is the ability to focus resources at a particular moment in time in order to optimise behaviour, and is associated with activation of left parietal and premotor cortex [Coull, J. T., Nobre, A. C. Where and when to pay attention: the neural systems for directing attention to spatial locations and to time intervals as revealed by both PET and fMRI. Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18, 7426-7435]. In the present experiment, we explored the behavioural and anatomical correlates of temporal orienting to foveal visual stimuli, in order to eliminate any spatial attention confounds. We implemented a two-way factorial design in an event-related fMRI study to examine the factors of trial validity (predictability of target by cue), length of delay (cue-target interval), and their interaction. There were two distinct types of invalid trial: those where attention was automatically drawn to a premature target and those where attention was voluntarily shifted to a delayed time-point. Reaction times for valid trials were shorter than those for invalid trials, demonstrating appropriate allocation of attention to temporal cues. All trial-types activated a shared system, including frontoparietal areas bilaterally, showing that this network is consistently associated with attentional orienting and is not specific to spatial tasks. Distinct brain areas were sensitive to cue-target delays and to trial validity. Long cue-target intervals activated areas involved in motor preparation: supplementary motor cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. Invalid trials, where temporal expectancies were breached, showed enhanced activation of left parietal and frontal areas, and engagement of orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally. Finally, trial validity interacted with length of delay. Appearance of targets prematurely selectively activated visual extrastriate cortex; while postponement of target appearance selectively activated right prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that distinct brain areas are involved in redirecting attention based upon sensory events (bottom-up, exogenous shifts) and based upon cognitive expectations (top-down, endogenous shifts).},

Alterations in postsynaptic glutamate receptors are believed to contribute to the expression of various forms of LTP and LTD, but the relative importance of presynaptic mechanisms is controversial. In addition, while aggregate synaptic input to a cell can undergo sequential and graded (incremental) LTP and LTD, it has been suggested that individual synapses may only support binary changes between initial and modified levels of strength. We have addressed these issues by combining electrophysiological methods with two-photon optical quantal analysis of plasticity at individual active (non-silent) Schaffer collateral synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute slices of hippocampus from adolescent rats. We find that these synapses sustain graded, bidirectional long-term plasticity. Remarkably, changes in potency are small and insignificant; long-term plasticity at these synapses is expressed overwhelmingly via presynaptic changes in reliability of transmitter release.},

There is growing evidence for the existence of developmental constraints in the biological literature. We hypothesize that a developmental constraint prevents the savant syndrome, despite its positive aspects, from spreading in the population. Here, the developmental constraint is the result of the high interactivity among body parts in an early stage in embryological development, namely early organogenesis or the phylotypic stage. The interactivity during this stage involves all components of the embryo, and as a result mutations that affect one part of the embryo also affect other parts. We hypothesize that a mutation, which gives rise to the development of the positive aspects of the savant syndrome (e.g., an impressive memory capacity), will virtually always have a deleterious effect on the development of other phenotypic traits (e.g., resulting in autism and/or impaired motor coordination). Thus, our hypothesis states that the savant syndrome cannot spread in the population because of this developmental constraint. The finding that children with savant syndrome often have autism and physical anomalies, which are known to be established during early organogenesis, supports our hypothesis.},

abstract = {Songbirds spend much of their time learning, producing, and listening to complex vocal sequences we call songs. Songs are learned via cultural transmission, and singing, usually by males, has a strong impact on the behavioral state of the listeners, often promoting affiliation, pair bonding, or aggression. What is it in the acoustic structure of birdsong that makes it such a potent stimulus? We suggest that birdsong potency might be driven by principles similar to those that make music so effective in inducing emotional responses in humans: a combination of rhythms and pitches-and the transitions between acoustic states-affecting emotions through creating expectations, anticipations, tension, tension release, or surprise. Here we propose a framework for investigating how birdsong, like human music, employs the above "musical" features to affect the emotions of avian listeners. First we analyze songs of thrush nightingales (Luscinia luscinia) by examining their trajectories in terms of transitions in rhythm and pitch. These transitions show gradual escalations and graceful modifications, which are comparable to some aspects of human musicality. We then explore the feasibility of stripping such putative musical features from the songs and testing how this might affect patterns of auditory responses, focusing on fMRI data in songbirds that demonstrate the feasibility of such approaches. Finally, we explore ideas for investigating whether musical features of birdsong activate avian brains and affect avian behavior in manners comparable to music's effects on humans. In conclusion, we suggest that birdsong research would benefit from current advances in music theory by attempting to identify structures that are designed to elicit listeners' emotions and then testing for such effects experimentally. Birdsong research that takes into account the striking complexity of song structure in light of its more immediate function - to affect behavioral state in listeners - could provide a useful animal model for studying basic principles of music neuroscience in a system that is very accessible for investigation, and where developmental auditory and social experience can be tightly controlled.

abstract = {A specific memory is thought to be encoded by a sparse population of neurons. These neurons can be tagged during learning for subsequent identification and manipulation. Moreover, their ablation or inactivation results in reduced memory expression, suggesting their necessity in mnemonic processes. However, the question of sufficiency remains: it is unclear whether it is possible to elicit the behavioural output of a specific memory by directly activating a population of neurons that was active during learning. Here we show in mice that optogenetic reactivation of hippocampal neurons activated during fear conditioning is sufficient to induce freezing behaviour. We labelled a population of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons activated during fear learning with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and later optically reactivated these neurons in a different context. The mice showed increased freezing only upon light stimulation, indicating light-induced fear memory recall. This freezing was not detected in non-fear-conditioned mice expressing ChR2 in a similar proportion of cells, nor in fear-conditioned mice with cells labelled by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein instead of ChR2. Finally, activation of cells labelled in a context not associated with fear did not evoke freezing in mice that were previously fear conditioned in a different context, suggesting that light-induced fear memory recall is context specific. Together, our findings indicate that activating a sparse but specific ensemble of hippocampal neurons that contribute to a memory engram is sufficient for the recall of that memory. Moreover, our experimental approach offers a general method of mapping cellular populations bearing memory engrams.},

abstract = {Dopamine is a key neuromodulatory transmitter in the brain. It acts through dopamine receptors to affect changes in neural activity, gene expression, and behavior. In songbirds, dopamine is released into the striatal song nucleus Area X, and the levels depend on social contexts of undirected and directed singing. This differential release is associated with differential expression of activity-dependent genes, such as egr1 (avian zenk), which in mammalian brain are modulated by dopamine receptors. Here we cloned from zebra finch brain cDNAs of all avian dopamine receptors: the D1 (D1A, D1B, D1D) and D2 (D2, D3, D4) families. Comparative sequence analyses of predicted proteins revealed expected phylogenetic relationships, in which the D1 family exists as single exon and the D2 family exists as spliced exon genes. In both zebra finch and chicken, the D1A, D1B, and D2 receptors were highly expressed in the striatum, the D1D and D3 throughout the pallium and within the mesopallium, respectively, and the D4 mainly in the cerebellum. Furthermore, within the zebra finch, all receptors, except for D4, showed differential expression in song nuclei relative to the surrounding regions and developmentally regulated expression that decreased for most receptors during the sensory acquisition and sensorimotor phases of song learning. Within Area X, half of the cells expressed both D1A and D2 receptors, and a higher proportion of the D1A-only-containing neurons expressed egr1 during undirected but not during directed singing. Our findings are consistent with hypotheses that dopamine receptors may be involved in song development and social context-dependent behaviors.},

abstract = {The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis of musical phrase boundary processing during the perception of music from native and non-native cultures. German musicians performed a cultural categorization task while listening to phrased Western (native) and Chinese (non-native) musical excerpts as well as modified versions of these, where the impression of phrasing has been reduced by removing the phrase boundary marking pause (henceforth called "unphrased"). Bilateral planum temporale was found to be associated with an increased difficulty of identifying phrase boundaries in unphrased Western melodies. A network involving frontal and parietal regions showed increased activation for the phrased condition with the orbital part of left inferior frontal gyrus presumably reflecting working memory aspects of the temporal integration between phrases, and the middle frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus probably reflecting attention processes. Areas more active in the culturally familiar, native (Western) condition included, in addition to the left planum temporale and right ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, mainly the bilateral motor regions. These latter results are interpreted in light of sensorimotor integration. Regions with increased signal for the unfamiliar, non-native music style (Chinese) included a right lateralized network of angular gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus, possibly reflecting higher demands on attention systems, and the right posterior insula suggesting higher loads on basic auditory processing.},

SWS density decreased whereas REM density increased throughout the night, with late-night characterized by substantially more REM than SWS, and relatively long bouts of REM. Birds share many features of sleep in common with mammals, but this collective suite of characteristics had not been known in any one species outside of mammals.

To achieve this, it rapidly modulates the operating mode of cortical circuits, controlling the way that information is transformed and routed. This article will focus on two experimental approaches by which the control of cortical information processing has been investigated: the study of state-dependent cortical processing in rodents and attention in the primate visual system. Both processes involve a modulation of low-frequency activity fluctuations and spiking correlation, and are mediated by common receptor systems. We suggest that selective attention involves processes that are similar to state change, and that operate at a local columnar level to enhance the representation of otherwise non-salient features while suppressing internally generated activity patterns.},

abstract = {Sensory stimulation can systematically bias the perceived passage of time, but why and how this happens is mysterious. In this report, we provide evidence that such biases may ultimately derive from an innate and adaptive use of stochastically evolving dynamic stimuli to help refine estimates derived from internal timekeeping mechanisms. A simplified statistical model based on probabilistic expectations of stimulus change derived from the second-order temporal statistics of the natural environment makes three predictions. First, random noise-like stimuli whose statistics violate natural expectations should induce timing bias. Second, a previously unexplored obverse of this effect is that similar noise stimuli with natural statistics should reduce the variability of timing estimates. Finally, this reduction in variability should scale with the interval being timed, so as to preserve the overall Weber law of interval timing. All three predictions are borne out experimentally. Thus, in the context of our novel theoretical framework, these results suggest that observers routinely rely on sensory input to augment their sense of the passage of time, through a process of Bayesian inference based on expectations of change in the natural environment.},

@article{Harrison2014,
abstract = {Overdispersion is common in models of count data in ecology and evolutionary biology, and can occur due to missing covariates, non-independent (aggregated) data, or an excess frequency of zeroes (zero-inflation). Accounting for overdispersion in such models is vital, as failing to do so can lead to biased parameter estimates, and false conclusions regarding hypotheses of interest. Observation-level random effects (OLRE), where each data point receives a unique level of a random effect that models the extra-Poisson variation present in the data, are commonly employed to cope with overdispersion in count data. However studies investigating the efficacy of observation-level random effects as a means to deal with overdispersion are scarce. Here I use simulations to show that in cases where overdispersion is caused by random extra-Poisson noise, or aggregation in the count data, observation-level random effects yield more accurate parameter estimates compared to when overdispersion is simply ignored. Conversely, OLRE fail to reduce bias in zero-inflated data, and in some cases increase bias at high levels of overdispersion. There was a positive relationship between the magnitude of overdispersion and the degree of bias in parameter estimates. Critically, the simulations reveal that failing to account for overdispersion in mixed models can erroneously inflate measures of explained variance (r (2)), which may lead to researchers overestimating the predictive power of variables of interest. This work suggests use of observation-level random effects provides a simple and robust means to account for overdispersion in count data, but also that their ability to minimise bias is not uniform across all types of overdispersion and must be applied judiciously.},

abstract = {Our objective was to demonstrate that human population-level, right-handedness, is not species specific, precipitated from language areas in the brain, but rather is context specific and inherited from a behavior common to both humans and great apes. In general, previous methods of assessing human handedness have neglected to consider the context of action, or employ methods suitable for direct comparison across species. We employed a bottom-up, context-sensitive method to quantitatively assess manual actions in right-handed, typically developing children during naturalistic behavior. By classifying the target to which participants directed a manual action, as animate (social partner, self) or inanimate (non-living functional objects), we found that children demonstrated a significant right-hand bias for manual actions directed toward inanimate targets, but not for manual actions directed toward animate targets. This pattern was revealed at both the group and individual levels. We used a focal video sampling, corpus data-mining approach to allow for direct comparisons with captive gorillas (Forrester et al. Animal Cognition 2011;14(6):903-7) and chimpanzees (Forrester et al. Animal Cognition, in press). Comparisons of handedness patters support the view that population-level, human handedness, and its origin in cerebral lateralization is not a new or human-unique characteristic. These data are consistent with the theory that human right-handedness is a trait developed through tool use that was inherited from an ancestor common to both humans and great apes.},

abstract = {We all have a sense of time. Yet, there are no sensory receptors specifically dedicated for perceiving time. It is an almost uniquely intangible sensation: we cannot see time in the way that we see color, shape, or even location. So how is time represented in the brain? We explore the neural substrates of metrical representations of time such as duration estimation (explicit timing) or temporal expectation (implicit timing). Basal ganglia (BG), supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex have all been linked to the explicit estimation of duration. However, each region may have a functionally discrete role and will be differentially implicated depending upon task context. Among these, the dorsal striatum of the BG and, more specifically, its ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway seems to be the most crucial of these regions, as shown by converging functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychopharmacological investigations in humans, as well as lesion and pharmacological studies in animals. Moreover, neuronal firing rates in both striatal and interconnected frontal areas vary as a function of duration, suggesting a neurophysiological mechanism for the representation of time in the brain, with the excitatory-inhibitory balance of interactions among distinct subtypes of striatal neuron serving to fine-tune temporal accuracy and precision.},

One emphasizes that the judgment of the duration of a stimulus depends on the operation of dedicated neural mechanisms specialized for representing the temporal relationships between events. Alternatively, the representation of duration could be ubiquitous, arising from the intrinsic dynamics of nondedicated neural mechanisms. In such models, duration might be encoded directly through the amount of activation of sensory processes or as spatial patterns of activity in a network of neurons. Although intrinsic models are neurally plausible, we highlight several issues that must be addressed before we dispense with models of duration perception that are based on dedicated processes.},

However, there is a lack of behavioral methodologies for comparing verbal and musical serial recall. We developed a visual grid response that allowed both musicians and nonmusicians to perform serial recall of letter and tone sequences. The new method was used to compare the phonological similarity effect with the impact of an operationalized musical equivalent-pitch proximity. Over the course of three experiments, we found that short-term memory for tones had several similarities to verbal memory, including limited capacity and a significant effect of pitch proximity in nonmusicians. Despite being vulnerable to phonological similarity when recalling letters, however, musicians showed no effect of pitch proximity, a result that we suggest might reflect strategy differences. Overall, the findings support a limited degree of correspondence in the way that verbal and musical sounds are processed in auditory short-term memory.},

abstract = {Some bird species will modify their songs in adulthood, whereas in others, once developed, song appears relatively fixed. However, even in some of the latter, social experience may lead birds to learn songs later than was previously thought possible. Do age-limited learners really exist or is failure to learn later in those species where it has been described a result of inadequate stimulation? If learning is normally restricted to a certain age period, is the decline in sensitivity due to age as such or to enough adequate information having been received? We discuss some of the issues involved and describe some experiments on zebra finches which we have carried out. Our results suggests that drastic changes in adulthood are rare. Birds deprived of tutors in the sensitive phase are more likely to produce elements learnt from the father before that stage, but show little evidence of learning from tutors encountered when adult (at 120 d+). Birds that are female-raised in groups and deprived of any male tutor till 120 days learn little from their tutors thereafter but have quite normal songs; these converge strongly within groups, as do the songs of all group-reared birds. Birds reared by both parents but without siblings, and then deprived of song during the sensitive phase, show learning both from the father and from the tutors encountered after 120 days. The most abnormal songs are those of birds reared by the mother alone and then kept singly till they were placed with singing adults at 120 days. The songs of these birds were more variable than those of the other groups, and they showed more evidence of learning between 120 and 240 days. These results do suggest some flexibility in the timing of song learning in zebra finches depending on experience but argue against profound change occurring once birds are adult even where their early experience has been greatly reduced.},

A preferred period hypothesis predicted a monotonic slowing of a preferred rate (tempo) of event tracking across the life span. An entrainment region hypothesis predicted a quadratic profile in the range of event rates that produced effective timing across the life span; specifically, age-specific entrainment regions should be narrower in childhood and late adulthood than in midlife. Findings across tasks provide converging support for both hypotheses.

abstract = {A core feature of social intelligence is the understanding of third-party relations, which has been experimentally demonstrated in primates. Whether other social animals also have this capacity, and whether they can use this capacity flexibly to, for example, also assess the relations of neighbouring conspecifics, remains unknown. Here we show that ravens react differently to playbacks of dominance interactions that either confirm or violate the current rank hierarchy of members in their own social group and of ravens in a neighbouring group. Therefore, ravens understand third-party relations and may deduce those not only via physical interactions but also by observation.},

abstract = {A recently described auditory tempo perception paradigm revealed individual differences in perceived stimulus timing for identical stimulus sequences. The current study takes advantage of this paradigm by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) concurrent with task performance in order to reveal brain responses that reflect individual differences in timing strategy. No strategy-related differences were observed in sensory encoding of tones, as measured by the P1-N1-P2 complex. However, the contingent negative variation (CNV) leading up to the final tone of the sequence varied as a function of strategy, as did a parietal-maximum late positive component (P3b) that occurred following the final tone. These data suggest that temporal expectancy for and cognitive processing of the final tone of rhythmic sequences underlies differences in strategy during rhythm perception.},

abstract = {Songbirds learn their song from an adult conspecific tutor when they are young, much like the acquisition of speech in human infants. When an adult zebra finch is re-exposed to its tutor's song, there is increased neuronal activation in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), the songbird equivalent of the auditory association cortex. This neuronal activation is related to the fidelity of song imitation, suggesting that the NCM may contain the neural representation of song memory. We found that bilateral neurotoxic lesions to the NCM of adult male zebra finches impaired tutor-song recognition but did not affect the males' song production or their ability to discriminate calls. These findings demonstrate that the NCM performs an essential role in the representation of tutor-song memory. In addition, our results show that tutor-song memory and a motor program for the bird's own song have separate neural representations in the songbird brain. Thus, in both humans and songbirds, the cognitive systems of vocal production and auditory recognition memory are subserved by distinct brain regions.},

abstract = {In this study, we explored ways to account more accurately for responses of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) to natural sounds. The auditory cortex has evolved to extract behaviorally relevant information from complex natural sounds, but most of our understanding of its function is derived from experiments using simple synthetic stimuli. Previous neurophysiological studies have found that existing models, such as the linear spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF), fail to capture the entire functional relationship between natural stimuli and neural responses. To study this problem, we compared STRFs for A1 neurons estimated using a natural stimulus, continuous speech, with STRFs estimated using synthetic ripple noise. For about one-third of the neurons, we found significant differences between STRFs, usually in the temporal dynamics of inhibition and/or overall gain. This shift in tuning resulted primarily from differences in the coarse temporal structure of the speech and noise stimuli. Using simulations, we found that the stimulus dependence of spectro-temporal tuning can be explained by a model in which synaptic inputs to A1 neurons are susceptible to rapid nonlinear depression. This dynamic reshaping of spectro-temporal tuning suggests that synaptic depression may enable efficient encoding of natural auditory stimuli.},

abstract = {Recent experiments on the genetic control of eye development have opened up a completely new perspective on eye evolution. The demonstration that targeted expression of one and the same master control gene, that is, Pax6 can induce the formation of ectopic eyes in both insects and vertebrates, necessitates a reconsideration of the dogma of a polyphyletic origin of the various eye types in all the animal phyla. The involvement of Pax6 and six1 and six3 genes, which encode highly conserved transcription factors, in the genetic control of eye development in organisms ranging from planarians to humans argues strongly for a monophyletic origin of the eye. Because transcription factors can control the expression of any target gene provided it contains the appropriate gene regulatory elements, the conservation of the genetic control of eye development by Pax6 among all bilaterian animals is not due to functional constraints but a consequence of its evolutionary history. The prototypic eyes postulated by Darwin to consist of two cells only, a photoreceptor and a pigment cell, were accidentally controlled by Pax6 and the subsequent evolution of the various eye types occurred by building onto this original genetic program. A hypothesis of intercalary evolution is proposed that assumes that the eye morphogenetic pathway is progressively modified by intercalation of genes between the master control genes on the top of the hierarchy and the structural genes like rhodopsin at the bottom. The recruitment of novel genes into the eye morphogenetic pathway can be due to at least two different genetic mechanisms, gene duplication and enhancer fusion.In tracing back the evolution of eyes beyond bilaterians, we find highly developed eyes in some box-jellyfish as well as in some Hydrozoans. In Hydrozoans the same orthologous six genes (six1 and six3) are required for eye regeneration as in planarians, and in the box jellyfish Tripedalia a pax B gene, which may be a precursor of Pax6, was found to be expressed in the eyes. In contrast to the adults, which have highly evolved eyes, the Planula larva of Tripedalia has single- celled photoreceptors similar to some unicellular protists. For the origin of photoreceptor cells in metazoa, I propose two hypotheses, one based on cellular differentiation and a more speculative one based on symbiosis. The former assumes that photoreceptor cells originated from a colonial protist in which all the cells were photosensitive and subsequent cellular differentiation to give rise to photoreceptor cells. The symbiont hypothesis, which I call the Russian doll model, assumes that photosensitivity arose first in photosynthetic cyanobacteria that were subsequently taken up into red algae as primary chloroplasts. The red algae in turn were taken up by dinoflagellates as secondary chloroplasts and in some species evolved into the most sophisticated eye organelles, as found, for example, in some dinoflagellates like Erythropsis and Warnovia, which lack chloroplasts. Because dinoflagellates are commonly found as symbionts in cnidarians, the dinoflagellates may have transferred their photoreceptor genes to cnidarians. In cnidarians such as Tripedalia the step from photoreceptor organelles to multicellular eyes has occurred. These two hypotheses, the cellular differentiation and the symbiont hypothesis, are not mutually exclusive and are the subject of further investigations.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that after kindling (a model of temporal lobe epilepsy), the neuroactive steroid tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) was unable to augment GABA type A receptor (GABA(A))-mediated synaptic currents occurring on pyramidal cells of the piriform cortex. Phosphorylation of GABA(A) receptors has been shown previously to alter the activity of THDOC, so we tested the hypothesis that kindling induces changes in the phosphorylation of GABA(A) receptors and this accounts for the loss in efficacy. To assay whether GABA(A) receptors are more phosphorylated after kindling, we examined the phosphorylation state of the $\beta$3 subunit and found that it was increased. Incubation of brain slices with the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (100 nM) also increased phosphorylation in the same assay. In patch clamp, recordings from non-kindled rat brain slices PMA also reduced the activity of THDOC in a manner that was identical to what is observed after kindling. We also found that the tonic current was no longer augmented by THODC after kindling and PMA treatment. The protein kinase C (PKC) antagonist bisindolylmaleimide I blocked the effects PMA on the synaptic but not the tonic currents. However, the broad spectrum PKC antagonist staurosporine blocked the effects of PMA on the tonic currents, implying that different PKC isoforms phosphorylate GABA(A) receptors responsible for phasic and tonic currents. The phosphatase activator Li(+) palmitate restored the 'normal' activity of THDOC on synaptic currents in kindled brain slices but not the tonic currents. These data demonstrate that kindling enhances the phosphorylation state of GABA(A) receptors expressed in pyramidal neurons reducing THDOC efficacy.},

abstract = {Astrocytes communicate with synapses by means of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) elevations, but local calcium dynamics in astrocytic processes have never been thoroughly investigated. By taking advantage of high-resolution two-photon microscopy, we identify the characteristics of local astrocyte calcium activity in the adult mouse hippocampus. Astrocytic processes showed intense activity, triggered by physiological transmission at neighboring synapses. They encoded synchronous synaptic events generated by sparse action potentials into robust regional (∼12 $\mu$m) [Ca(2+)](i) elevations. Unexpectedly, they also sensed spontaneous synaptic events, producing highly confined (∼4 $\mu$m), fast (millisecond-scale) miniature Ca(2+) responses. This Ca(2+) activity in astrocytic processes is generated through GTP- and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent signaling and is relevant for basal synaptic function. Thus, buffering astrocyte [Ca(2+)](i) or blocking a receptor mediating local astrocyte Ca(2+) signals decreased synaptic transmission reliability in minimal stimulation experiments. These data provide direct evidence that astrocytes are integrated in local synaptic functioning in adult brain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specialized neural pathways, the song system, are required for acquiring, producing, and perceiving learned avian vocalizations. Birds that do not learn to produce their vocalizations lack telencephalic song system components. It is not known whether the song system forebrain regions are exclusively evolved for song or whether they also process information not related to song that might reflect their 'evolutionary history'.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this question we monitored the induction of two immediate-early genes (IEGs) c-Fos and ZENK in various regions of the song system in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in response to an aversive food learning paradigm; this involves the association of a food item with a noxious stimulus that affects the oropharyngeal-esophageal cavity and tongue, causing subsequent avoidance of that food item. The motor response results in beak and head movements but not vocalizations. IEGs have been extensively used to map neuro-molecular correlates of song motor production and auditory processing. As previously reported, neurons in two pallial vocal motor regions, HVC and RA, expressed IEGs after singing. Surprisingly, c-Fos was induced equivalently also after food aversion learning in the absence of singing. The density of c-Fos positive neurons was significantly higher than that of birds in control conditions. This was not the case in two other pallial song nuclei important for vocal plasticity, LMAN and Area X, although singing did induce IEGs in these structures, as reported previously.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results are consistent with the possibility that some of the song nuclei may participate in non-vocal learning and the populations of neurons involved in the two tasks show partial overlap. These findings underscore the previously advanced notion that the specialized forebrain pre-motor nuclei controlling song evolved from circuits involved in behaviors related to feeding.},

abstract = {Synchronization of body movements to an external beat is a universal human ability, which has also been recently documented in nonhuman species. The neural substrates of this rhythmic motor entrainment are still under investigation. Correlational neuroimaging data suggest an involvement of the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). In 14 healthy volunteers, we more specifically investigated the neural network underlying this phenomenon using a causal approach by an established 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocol, which produces a focal suppression of cortical excitability outlasting the stimulation period. Synchronization accuracy between rhythmic cues and right index finger tapping, as measured by the mean time lag (asynchrony) between motor and auditory events, was significantly affected when the right dPMC function was transiently perturbed by "off-line" focal rTMS, whereas the reproduction of the rhythmic sequence per se (inter-tap-interval) was spared. This approach affected metrical rhythms of different complexity, but not non-metrical or isochronous sequences. Conversely, no change in auditory-motor synchronization was observed with rTMS of the SMA, of the left dPMC or over a control site (midline occipital area). Our data strongly support the view that the right dPMC is crucial for rhythmic auditory-motor synchronization in humans.},

abstract = {A complex neural system controls birdsong learning, but its organization is not understood, nor is it known why learning only occurs during a critical period in adolescence. Here, we analyzed developmental regulation in zebra finches of zenk, an immediate-early gene (IEG) implicated in memory consolidation. Basal expression was elevated within auditory telencephalon (specifically, within the caudomedial neostriatum [NCM]) during song acquisition. Expression could be further induced by song playbacks 30 days after hatching but not at 20 days nor in juveniles reared in severe isolation. Singing itself induced zenk in song production nuclei, including Area X, even in adults. Within a compartment of the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), however, this response dwindled as singing matured. These results suggest that the onset of sensory memory storage may be regulated in part at NCM, and motor plasticity may be regulated at RA.},

abstract = {New experiences can trigger changes in gene expression in the brain. To understand this phenomenon better, we studied zebra finches hearing playbacks of birdsong. Earlier research had shown that initial playbacks of a novel song transiently increase the ZENK (ZIF-268, EGR1, NGFIA, KROX-24) mRNA in the auditory forebrain, but the response selectively habituates after repetition of the stimulus. Here, using DNA microarray analysis, we show that novel song exposure induces rapid changes in thousands of RNAs, with even more RNAs decreasing than increasing. Habituation training leads to the emergence of a different gene expression profile a day later, accompanied by loss of essentially all of the rapid "novel" molecular responses. The novel molecular profile is characterized by increases in genes involved in transcription and RNA processing and decreases in ion channels and putative noncoding RNAs. The "habituated" profile is dominated by changes in genes for mitochondrial proteins. A parallel proteomic analysis [2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and sequencing by mass spectrometry] also detected changes in mitochondrial proteins, and direct enzyme assay demonstrated changes in both complexes I and IV in the habituated state. Thus a natural experience, in this case hearing the sound of birdsong, can lead to major shifts in energetics and macromolecular metabolism in higher centers in the brain.},

abstract = {There is increased neuronal firing in the high vocal center (a motor nucleus) and other song nuclei of canaries, Serinus canaria, and zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, whenever these songbirds sing or hear song. These observations suggested that song perception involved sensory and motor pathways. We now show that the act of singing, but not hearing song, induces a rapid and striking increase (up to 60-fold) in expression of the transcriptional regulator ZENK in the high vocal center and other song nuclei. This motor-driven gene expression is independent of auditory feedback, since it occurs in deafened birds when they sing and in muted birds when they produce silent song. Conversely, hearing song, but not the act of singing, induces ZENK expression in parts of the auditory forebrain. Our observations show that even though the same auditory stimulus activates sensory and motor pathways, perception and production of song are accompanied by anatomically distinct patterns of gene expression.},

Here, we provide evidence that SLRs unmasked by cerebellar cortex lesions are mediated by an associative form of learning-induced plasticity in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) of the cerebellum. We used pharmacological inactivation and/or electrical microstimulation of various sites afferent and efferent to the AIN to systematically eliminate alternative candidate sites of plasticity upstream or downstream from this structure. Collectively, the results suggest that cerebellar learning is mediated in part by plasticity in target nuclei downstream of the cerebellar cortex. These data demonstrate an instance in which an aspect of associative learning, SLRs, can be used as an index of plasticity at a specific site in the brain.},

Zann was the first to summarise the immense and integrative research effort in a landmark synthesis of field and laboratory studies of Zebra Finches, which paralleled his own championing work on the sociality and vocal behaviour of estrildid finches in the wild and in captivity. The study of the production and perception of Zebra Finch song has driven theoretical, empirical and technological advances in behavioural ecology, endocrinology and neuroethology, and led to a greater understanding of the evolution of animal communication systems in general. A survey of the literature shows that there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the responses of non-singing females to male sexual displays, including song. We focus on recent insights into the features and functions of male song that shape female choice, regarding both behavioural and neurobiological measures of selectivity. This review underscores the need for continued research into the biological mechanisms underlying the perception of male song by female Zebra Finches and confirms this system as a valuable and productive model for research on animal communication.},

Distributions of larger samples tend to resemble the distribution of the characteristic in the population better by taking on a bell-shaped curve when the values of a characteristic in the population are plotted against their frequency.},

abstract = {Most of our motor skills are not innately programmed, but are learned by a combination of motor exploration and performance evaluation, suggesting that they proceed through a reinforcement learning (RL) mechanism. Songbirds have emerged as a model system to study how a complex behavioral sequence can be learned through an RL-like strategy. Interestingly, like motor sequence learning in mammals, song learning in birds requires a basal ganglia (BG)-thalamocortical loop, suggesting common neural mechanisms. Here, we outline a specific working hypothesis for how BG-forebrain circuits could utilize an internally computed reinforcement signal to direct song learning. Our model includes a number of general concepts borrowed from the mammalian BG literature, including a dopaminergic reward prediction error and dopamine-mediated plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. We also invoke a number of conceptual advances arising from recent observations in the songbird. Specifically, there is evidence for a specialized cortical circuit that adds trial-to-trial variability to stereotyped cortical motor programs, and a role for the BG in "biasing" this variability to improve behavioral performance. This BG-dependent "premotor bias" may in turn guide plasticity in downstream cortical synapses to consolidate recently learned song changes. Given the similarity between mammalian and songbird BG-thalamocortical circuits, our model for the role of the BG in this process may have broader relevance to mammalian BG function.},

We found that astrocytes of the brainstem chemoreceptor areas are highly chemosensitive. They responded to physiological decreases in pH with vigorous elevations in intracellular Ca2+ and release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP propagated astrocytic Ca2+ excitation, activated chemoreceptor neurons, and induced adaptive increases in breathing. Mimicking pH-evoked Ca2+ responses by means of optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes expressing channelrhodopsin-2 activated chemoreceptor neurons via an ATP-dependent mechanism and triggered robust respiratory responses in vivo. This demonstrates a potentially crucial role for brain glial cells in mediating a fundamental physiological reflex.},

abstract = {It is widely appreciated that the key predictor of the pitch of a sound is its periodicity. Neural structures which support pitch perception must therefore be able to reflect the repetition rate of a sound, but this alone is not sufficient. Since pitch is a psychoacoustic property, a putative cortical code for pitch must also be able to account for the relationship between the amount to which a sound is periodic (i.e. its temporal regularity) and the perceived pitch salience, as well as limits in our ability to detect pitch changes or to discriminate rising from falling pitch. Pitch codes must also be robust in the presence of nuisance variables such as loudness or timbre. Here, we review a large body of work on the cortical basis of pitch perception, which illustrates that the distribution of cortical processes that give rise to pitch perception is likely to depend on both the acoustical features and functional relevance of a sound. While previous studies have greatly advanced our understanding, we highlight several open questions regarding the neural basis of pitch perception. These questions can begin to be addressed through a cooperation of investigative efforts across species and experimental techniques, and, critically, by examining the responses of single neurons in behaving animals.},

However, whether inducible transcription relays information about the identity and affective attributes of the experience being encoded, has not been explored. To this end, we analyzed transcription induced by a variety of rewarding and aversive experiences, across multiple brain regions. Our results describe the existence of robust transcriptional signatures uniquely representing distinct experiences, enabling near-perfect decoding of recent experiences. Furthermore, experiences with shared attributes display commonalities in their transcriptional signatures, exemplified in the representation of valence, habituation and reinforcement. This study introduces the concept of a neural transcriptional code, which represents the encoding of experiences in the mouse brain. This code is comprised of distinct transcriptional signatures that correlate to attributes of the experiences that are being committed to long-term memory.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We call this effect fraternal inhibition. Fraternal inhibition was avoided by members of a clutch that developed the song first. To our surprise, this role commonly fell to one of the younger birds in the clutch. Early song learning may influence fitness since individuals that produced the most complete imitations also tended to induce more egg laying.},

abstract = {Subcortical loops through the basal ganglia and the cerebellum form computationally powerful distributed processing modules (DPMs). This paper relates the computational features of a DPM's loop through the basal ganglia to experimental results for two kinds of natural action selection. First, functional imaging during a serial order recall task was used to study human brain activity during the selection of sequential actions from working memory. Second, microelectrode recordings from monkeys trained in a step-tracking task were used to study the natural selection of corrective submovements. Our DPM-based model assisted in the interpretation of puzzling data from both of these experiments. We come to posit that the many loops through the basal ganglia each regulate the embodiment of pattern formation in a given area of cerebral cortex. This operation serves to instantiate different kinds of action (or thought) mediated by different areas of cerebral cortex. We then use our findings to formulate a model of the aetiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Norepinephrine (NE) is thought to play important roles in the consolidation and retrieval of long-term memories, but its role in the processing and memorization of complex acoustic signals used for vocal communication has yet to be determined. We have used a combination of gene expression analysis, electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations in zebra finches to examine the role of noradrenergic transmission in the brain's response to birdsong, a learned vocal behavior that shares important features with human speech. We show that noradrenergic transmission is required for both the expression of activity-dependent genes and the long-term maintenance of stimulus-specific electrophysiological adaptation that are induced in central auditory neurons by stimulation with birdsong. Specifically, we show that the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), an area directly involved in the auditory processing and memorization of birdsong, receives strong noradrenergic innervation. Song-responsive neurons in this area express $\alpha$-adrenergic receptors and are in close proximity to noradrenergic terminals. We further show that local $\alpha$-adrenergic antagonism interferes with song-induced gene expression, without affecting spontaneous or evoked electrophysiological activity, thus dissociating the molecular and electrophysiological responses to song. Moreover, $\alpha$-adrenergic antagonism disrupts the maintenance but not the acquisition of the adapted physiological state. We suggest that the noradrenergic system regulates long-term changes in song-responsive neurons by modulating the gene expression response that is associated with the electrophysiological activation triggered by song. We also suggest that this mechanism may be an important contributor to long-term auditory memories of learned vocalizations.},

abstract = {Social cues modulate the performance of communicative behaviors in a range of species, including humans, and such changes can make the communication signal more salient. In songbirds, males use song to attract females, and song organization can differ depending on the audience to which a male sings. For example, male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) change their songs in subtle ways when singing to a female (directed song) compared with when they sing in isolation (undirected song), and some of these changes depend on altered neural activity from a specialized forebrain-basal ganglia circuit, the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). In particular, variable activity in the AFP during undirected song is thought to actively enable syllable variability, whereas the lower and less-variable AFP firing during directed singing is associated with more stereotyped song. Consequently, directed song has been suggested to reflect a "performance" state, and undirected song a form of vocal motor "exploration." However, this hypothesis predicts that directed-undirected song differences, despite their subtlety, should matter to female zebra finches, which is a question that has not been investigated. We tested female preferences for this natural variation in song in a behavioral approach assay, and we found that both mated and socially naive females could discriminate between directed and undirected song-and strongly preferred directed song. These preferences, which appeared to reflect attention especially to aspects of song variability controlled by the AFP, were enhanced by experience, as they were strongest for mated females responding to their mate's directed songs. We then measured neural activity using expression of the immediate early gene product ZENK, and found that social context and song familiarity differentially modulated the number of ZENK-expressing cells in telencephalic auditory areas. Specifically, the number of ZENK-expressing cells in the caudomedial mesopallium (CMM) was most affected by whether a song was directed or undirected, whereas the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) was most affected by whether a song was familiar or unfamiliar. Together these data demonstrate that females detect and prefer the features of directed song and suggest that high-level auditory areas including the CMM are involved in this social perception.},

abstract = {Birdsong is a culturally transmitted mating signal: young birds learn specific variants of species-specific song(s) from conspecific models. Female song preferences are also learned early in life, but despite the potential functional implications of such learned mating preferences, we still have a poor understanding of when and from whom females learn. This also holds true for one of the foremost models of vocal learning, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Both male and female zebra finches memorize their tutor's song motif: as adults, males will sing and females prefer their tutor's song. We here tested whether juvenile females would also learn to prefer the songs of several individuals, and whether the timing and propensity of song preference learning were condition dependent. Young females raised and cross-fostered in experimentally manipulated brood sizes were exposed to several model songs: first their foster father's song until nutritional independence (days 0-35) and then as subadults to playbacks of two different tutor songs (days 35-65). As adults, females preferred all three model songs over unfamiliar songs. There were no interaction effects between females' early rearing conditions (brood size) and preference strength for the different tutor songs. An additional live-tutored group had equally strong preferences for the foster father's song (only heard before day 35) as the tape-tutored females. The combined results demonstrate that subadult females memorize several song types during different times of development and as adults prefer these songs over unfamiliar songs. These findings imply that multiple song learning needs to be taken into account for avian mate choice studies even in species that lack song type repertoires but show individual differences in song.},

abstract = {Many models have investigated how the process of speciation may occur in sympatry. In these models, individuals are either asexual or mate choice is determined by very simple rules. Females, for example, may be assumed either to compare their phenotype to that of a potential mate, preferring to mate with similar males (phenotype matching), or to possess preference genes that determine which male phenotype they prefer. These rules often do not reflect the mate-choice rules found in empirical studies. In this paper, we compare these two modes of female choice with various types of sexual imprinting. We examine the efficacy of different mate-choice behavior in causing divergence in male traits under simple deterministic one-locus population genetic models as well as under polygenic, individual-based simulations based on the models of Dieckmann and Doebeli (1999). We find that the inheritance mechanism of mate choice can have a large effect on the ease of sympatric speciation. When females imprint on their mothers, the result of the model is similar to phenotype matching, where speciation can occur fairly easily. When females imprint on their fathers or imprint obliquely, speciation becomes considerably less likely. Finally, when females rely on preference genes, male trait evolution occurs easily, but the correlation between trait and preference can be weak, and interpreting these results as speciation may be suspect.},

In Experiment 2, ten repetitions of two audiovisual incongruency conditions x nine audiovisual delays were presented to 13 drummers and 13 novices. Participants gave forced-choice judgments of audiovisual synchrony. The results of Experiment 1 show an enhancement in experts' ability to detect asynchrony, especially for slower drumming tempos. In Experiment 2 an increase in sensitivity to asynchrony was found for incongruent stimuli; this increase, however, is attributable only to the novice group. Altogether the results indicated that through musical practice we learn to ignore variations in stimulus characteristics that otherwise would affect our multisensory integration processes.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that the mirror neuron system provides an important neural substrate for humans' ability to imitate. Mirror neurons have been found during single-cell recordings in monkeys in area F5 and PF. It is believed that the human equivalent of this mirror system in humans is the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (area 44) and the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule. This article critically reviews published fMRI studies that examined the role of frontal and parietal brain regions in imitation. A meta-analysis using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) revealed that the superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule, and the dorsal premotor cortex but not the inferior frontal gyrus, are all commonly involved in imitation. An additional meta-analysis using a label-based review confirmed that in the frontal lobe, the premotor cortex rather than the inferior frontal gyrus is consistently active in studies investigating imitation. In the parietal region the superior and inferior parietal lobules are equally activated during imitation. Our results suggest that parietal and frontal regions which extend beyond the classical mirror neuron network are crucial for imitation.},

abstract = {In songbirds, as in mammals, basal ganglia-forebrain circuits are necessary for the learning and production of complex motor behaviors; however, the precise role of these circuits remains unknown. It has recently been shown that a basal ganglia-forebrain circuit in the songbird, which projects directly to vocal-motor circuitry, has a premotor function driving exploration necessary for vocal learning. It has also been hypothesized that this circuit, known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), may generate an instructive signal that improves performance in the motor pathway. Here, we show that the output of the AFP directly implements a motor correction that reduces vocal errors. We use disruptive auditory feedback, contingent on song pitch, to induce learned changes in song structure over the course of hours and find that reversible inactivation of the output of the AFP produces an immediate regression of these learned changes. Thus, the AFP is involved in generating an error-reducing bias, which could increase the efficiency of vocal exploration and instruct synaptic changes in the motor pathway. We also find that learned changes in the song generated by the AFP are incorporated into the motor pathway within 1 day. Our observations support a view that basal ganglia-related circuits directly implement behavioral adaptations that minimize errors and subsequently stabilize these adaptations by training premotor cortical areas.},

abstract = {Future clinical trials of neuroprotection in prodromal Huntington's (known as preHD) will require sensitive in vivo imaging biomarkers to track disease progression over the shortest period. Since basal ganglia atrophy is the most prominent structural characteristic of Huntington's pathology, systematic assessment of longitudinal subcortical atrophy holds great potential for future biomarker development. We studied 36 preHD and 22 age-matched controls using a novel method to quantify regional change from T(1) -weighted structural images acquired 1 year apart. We assessed cross-sectional volume differences and longitudinal volumetric change in 7 subcortical structures-the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus. At baseline, accumbens, caudate, pallidum, and putamen volumes were reduced in preHD versus controls (all P {\textless} .01). Longitudinally, atrophy was greater in preHD than controls in the caudate, pallidum, and putamen (all P {\textless} .01). Each structure showed a large between-group effect size, especially the pallidum where Cohen's d was 1.21. Using pallidal atrophy as a biomarker, we estimate that a hypothetical 1-year neuroprotection study would require only 35 preHD per arm to detect a 50{\%} slowing in atrophy and only 138 preHD per arm to detect a 25{\%} slowing in atrophy. The effect sizes calculated for preHD basal ganglia atrophy over 1 year are some of the largest reported to date. Consequently, this translates to strikingly small sample size estimates that will greatly facilitate any future neuroprotection study. This underscores the utility of this automatic image segmentation and longitudinal nonlinear registration method for upcoming studies of preHD and other neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {In the hippocampus, as in many other CNS areas, nitric oxide (NO) participates in synaptic plasticity, manifested as changes in pre- and/or postsynaptic function. While it is known that these changes are brought about by cGMP following activation of guanylyl cyclase-coupled NO receptors attempts to locate cGMP by immunocytochemistry in hippocampal slices in response to NO have failed to detect the cGMP elevation where expected, i.e. in the pyramidal neurones. Instead, astrocytes, unidentified varicose fibres and GABA-ergic nerve terminals are reported to be the prominent NO targets, raising the possibility that NO acts indirectly via other cells. We have re-investigated the distribution of cGMP generated in response to endogenous and exogenous NO in hippocampal slices using immunohistochemistry and new conditions designed to optimise cGMP accumulation and, hence, its detectability. The conditions included use of tissue from the developing rat hippocampus, a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-2, and an allosteric enhancer of the NO-receptive guanylyl cyclase. Under these conditions, cGMP was formed in response to endogenous NO and was found in a population of pyramidal cell somata in area CA3 and subiculum as well as in structures described previously. The additional presence of exogenous NO resulted in hippocampal cGMP reaching the highest level recorded for brain tissue (1700 pmol/mg protein) and in cGMP immunolabelling throughout the pyramidal cell layer. Populations of axons and interneurones were also stained. According with these results, immunohistochemistry for the common NO receptor $\beta$1-subunit indicated widespread expression. A similar staining pattern for the $\alpha$1-subunit with an antibody used previously in the hippocampus and elsewhere, however, proved to be artefactual. The results indicate that the targets of NO in the hippocampus are more varied and extensive than previous evidence had suggested and, in particular, that the pyramidal neurones participating in NO-dependent synaptic plasticity are direct NO targets.},

Furthermore, humans are perhaps the only mammals who have preferential handedness, with more than 90{\%} of the population more skillful at using the right hand, which is controlled by the left hemisphere. How is a distinct function consistently localized in one side of the human brain? Because of the convergence of molecular and neurological analysis, we are beginning to consider the puzzle of brain asymmetry and handedness at a molecular level.},

abstract = {Models of discrimination based on statistical decision theory distinguish sensitivity (the ability of an observer to reflect a stimulus-response correspondence denned by the experimenter) from response bias (the tendency to favor 1 response over others). Measures of response bias have received less attention than those of sensitivity. Bias measures are classified here according to 1 characteristics. First, the distributions assumed or implied to underlie the observer's decision may be normal, logis- tic, or rectangular. Second, the bias index may measure criterion location, criterion location relative to sensitivity, or likelihood ratio. Both parametric and "nonparametric" indexes are classified in this manner. The various bias statistics are compared on pragmatic and theoretical grounds, and it is concluded that criterion location measures have many advantages in empirical work.},

abstract = {The apparent duration of a visual stimulus has been shown to be influenced by its speed. For low speeds, apparent duration increases linearly with stimulus speed. This effect has been ascribed to the number of changes that occur within a visual interval. Accordingly, a higher number of changes should produce an increase in apparent duration. In order to test this prediction, we asked subjects to compare the relative duration of a 10-Hz drifting comparison stimulus with a standard stimulus that contained a different number of changes in different conditions. The standard could be static, drifting at 10 Hz, or mixed (a combination of variable duration static and drifting intervals). In this last condition the number of changes was intermediate between the static and the continuously drifting stimulus. For all standard durations, the mixed stimulus looked significantly compressed (∼20{\%} reduction) relative to the drifting stimulus. However, no difference emerged between the static (that contained no changes) and the mixed stimuli (which contained an intermediate number of changes). We also observed that when the standard was displayed first, it appeared compressed relative to when it was displayed second with a magnitude that depended on standard duration. These results are at odds with a model of time perception that simply reflects the number of temporal features within an interval in determining the perceived passing of time.},

abstract = {Zebra finch song has provided an excellent case study in the neural basis of sequence learning, with a high degree of temporal precision and tight links with precisely timed bursting in forebrain neurons. To examine the development of song timing, we measured four aspects of song temporal structure at four age ranges between 65 and 375 days post hatch: the mean durations of song syllables and the silent gaps between them, timing variability linked to song tempo, timing variability expressed independently across syllables and gaps, and transition probabilities between consecutive syllable pairs. We found substantial increases in song tempo between 65 and 85 days post hatch, due almost entirely to a shortening of gaps. We also found a decrease in tempo variability, also specific to gaps. Both the magnitude of the increase in tempo and the decrease in tempo variability were correlated on gap-by-gap basis with increases in the reliability of corresponding syllable transitions. Syllables had no systematic increase in tempo or decrease in tempo variability. In contrast to tempo parameters, both syllables and gaps showed an early sharp reduction in independent variability followed by continued reductions over the first year. The data suggest that links between syllable-based representations are strengthened during the later parts of the traditional period of song learning, and that song rhythm continues to become more regular throughout the first year of life. Similar learning patterns have been identified in human sequence learning, suggesting a potentially rich area of comparative research.},

abstract = {When songbirds hear the song of another individual of the same species or when they sing, the mRNA levels of the ZENK gene increase rapidly in forebrain areas involved in vocal communication. This gene induction is thought to be related to long-term neuronal change and possibly the formation of song-related memories. We used immunocytochemistry to study the levels and distribution of ZENK protein in the brain of zebra finches and canaries after presentation of song playbacks. Birds that heard the playbacks and did not sing in response showed increased ZENK protein levels in auditory brain areas, including the caudomedial neostriatum and hyperstriatum ventrale, fields L1 and L3, the shelf adjacent to the high vocal center (HVC), the cup adjacent to the nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), and the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis (MLd). No ZENK expression was seen in song nuclei in these birds. Males that sang in response to the playbacks showed, in addition to auditory areas, increased ZENK protein in several song control nuclei, most prominently in HVC, RA, area X, and the dorsomedial nucleus (DN) of the intercollicular complex. The rise in ZENK protein followed that described previously for ZENK mRNA by a short lag, and the distribution of ZENK-labeled cells was in agreement with previous analysis of mRNA distribution. Thus, ZENK protein regulation can be used to assess activation of brain areas involved in perceptual and motor aspects of song. Possible implications of ZENK induction in these areas are discussed.},

abstract = {Neurons of the motor thalamus mediate basal ganglia and cerebellar influences on cortical activity. To elucidate the net result of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid-releasing or glutamatergic bombardment of the motor thalamus by basal ganglia or cerebellar afferents, respectively, we recorded the spontaneous activities of thalamocortical neurons in distinct identified "input zones" in anesthetized rats during defined cortical activity states. Unexpectedly, the mean rates and brain state dependencies of the firing of neurons in basal ganglia-recipient zone (BZ) and cerebellar-recipient zone (CZ) were matched during slow-wave activity (SWA) and cortical activation. However, neurons were distinguished during SWA by their firing regularities, low-threshold spike bursts and, more strikingly, by the temporal coupling of their activities to ongoing cortical oscillations. The firing of neurons across the BZ was stronger and more precisely phase-locked to cortical slow (∼1 Hz) oscillations, although both neuron groups preferentially fired at the same phase. In contrast, neurons in BZ and CZ fired at different phases of cortical spindles (7-12 Hz), but with similar strengths of coupled firing. Thus, firing rates do not reflect the predicted inhibitory-excitatory imbalance across the motor thalamus, and input zone-specific temporal coding through oscillatory synchronization with the cortex could partly mediate the different roles of basal ganglia and cerebellum in behavior.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that the neural circuits involved in beat perception overlap with motor circuitry even in the absence of overt movement. This study investigated effects of tempo on beat-based processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a perceptual timing paradigm where participants made simple temporal judgments about short rhythmic sequences. Of central interest were judgments about ambiguous test rhythms where the perceived direction of a timing deviation ("speeding up" vs. "slowing down") depended on the induction of an implied beat. Successful beat induction was reduced when the implied beat was at a slower tempo (1,500 ms) than when it was at a faster tempo (600 ms). Decreased beat induction was accompanied by decreased functional activity in the basal ganglia, premotor and supplementary motor regions, and thalamus. Findings support the conclusion that rhythms presented at a slow tempo reduce involvement of a striato-thalamo-cortico network in beat-based processing.},

It is known that this exploratory variability requires the "cortical" component of a basal ganglia (BG) thalamocortical loop, but less understood is the role of the BG and thalamic components in this behavior. We found that large bilateral lesions to the songbird BG homolog Area X had little or no effect on song variability during vocal babbling. In contrast, lesions to the BG-recipient thalamic nucleus DLM (medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamus) largely abolished normal vocal babbling in young birds and caused a dramatic increase in song stereotypy. These findings support the idea that the motor thalamus plays a key role in the expression of exploratory juvenile behaviors during learning.},

abstract = {The GABA(A) receptor $\gamma$2 subunit nonsense mutation Q351X has been associated with the genetic epilepsy syndrome generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, which includes a spectrum of seizures types from febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome. Although most genetic epilepsy syndromes are mild and remit with age, Dravet syndrome has a more severe clinical course with refractory seizures associated with developmental delay and cognitive impairment. The basis for the broad spectrum of seizure phenotypes is uncertain. We demonstrated previously that the GABA(A) receptor $\gamma$2 subunit gene Q351X mutation suppressed biogenesis of wild-type partnering $\alpha$1 and $\beta$2 subunits in addition to its loss of function. Here we show that $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunits have an additional impairment of biogenesis. Mutant $\gamma$2(Q351X) subunits were degraded more slowly than wild-type $\gamma$2 subunits and formed SDS-resistant, high-molecular-mass complexes or aggregates in multiple cell types, including neurons. The half-life of $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunits was ∼4 h, whereas that of $\gamma$2S subunits was ∼2 h. Mutant subunits formed complexes rapidly after synthesis onset. Using multiple truncated subunits, we demonstrated that aggregate formation was a general phenomenon for truncated $\gamma$2S subunits and that their Cys-loop cysteines were involved in aggregate formation. Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, but the effects of the mutant $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunit aggregates on neuronal function and survival are unclear. Additional validation of the mutant subunit aggregation in vivo and determination of the involved signaling pathways will help reveal the pathological effects of these mutant subunit aggregates in the pathogenesis of genetic epilepsy syndromes.},

First, we describe the current state of understanding of the molecular architecture of the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways that has resulted from synergistic studies in vertebrate, invertebrate, and cultured cell model systems. Then, focusing specifically on the Drosophila eye, we discuss how cooperative, sequential, and antagonistic relationships between these pathways mediate the spatially and temporally regulated processes that generate this sensory organ. The common themes underlying the coordination of the EGFR and Notch pathways appear to be broadly conserved and should, therefore, be directly applicable to elucidating mechanisms of information integration and signaling specificity in vertebrate systems.},

For example, natural scenes display a Fourier power spectrum that tends to fall with spatial frequency according to a power-law. This result indicates that natural scenes have fractal-like, scale-invariant properties. In the present study, we asked whether visual art displays similar statistical properties by measuring their Fourier power spectra. Our analysis was restricted to graphic art from the Western hemisphere. For comparison, we also analyzed images, which generally display relatively low or no esthetic quality (household and laboratory objects, parts of plants, and scientific illustrations). Graphic art, but not the other image categories, resembles natural scenes in showing fractal-like, scale-invariant statistics. This property is universal in our sample of graphic art; it is independent of cultural variables, such as century and country of origin, techniques used or subject matter. We speculate that both graphic art and natural scenes share statistical properties because visual art is adapted to the structure of the visual system which, in turn, is adapted to process optimally the image statistics of natural scenes.},

abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive performance increase from early to late adulthood, likely reflecting influences of a multitude of factors. We hypothesize that losses in neurochemical and anatomical brain resources in normal aging modulate the effects of common genetic variations on cognitive functioning. Our hypothesis is based on the assumption that the function relating brain resources to cognition is nonlinear, so that genetic differences exert increasingly large effects on cognition as resources recede from high to medium levels in the course of aging. Direct empirical support for this hypothesis comes from a study by Nagel et al. (2008), who reported that the effects of the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene on cognitive performance are magnified in old age and interacted with the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) gene. We conclude that common genetic polymorphisms contribute to the increasing heterogeneity of cognitive functioning in old age. Extensions of the hypothesis to other polymorphisms are discussed.

abstract = {How the cerebellum is involved in the practice and proficiency of non-motor functions is still unclear. We tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the cerebellum (cerebellar tDCS) induces after-effects on the practice-dependent increase in the proficiency of a working memory (WM) task (Sternberg test) in 13 healthy subjects. We also assessed the effects of cerebellar tDCS on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in four subjects and compared the effects of cerebellar tDCS on the Sternberg test with those elicited by tDCS delivered over the prefrontal cortex in five subjects. Our experiments showed that anodal or cathodal tDCS over the cerebellum impaired the practice-dependent improvement in the reaction times in a WM task. Because tDCS delivered over the prefrontal cortex induced an immediate change in the WM task but left the practice-dependent proficiency unchanged, the effects of cerebellar tDCS are structure-specific. Cerebellar tDCS left VEPs unaffected, its effect on the Sternberg task therefore seems unlikely to arise from visual system involvement. In conclusion, tDCS over the cerebellum specifically impairs the practice-dependent proficiency increase in verbal WM.},

abstract = {Research suggests that music, like language, is both a biological predisposition and a cultural universal. While humans naturally attend to and process many of the psychophysical cues present in musical information, there is a great - and often culture-specific - diversity of musical practices differentiated in part by form, timbre, pitch, rhythm, and other structural elements. Musical interactions situated within a given cultural context begin to influence human responses to music as early as one year of age. Despite the world's diversity of musical cultures, the majority of research in cognitive psychology and the cognitive neuroscience of music has been conducted on subjects and stimuli from Western music cultures. From the standpoint of cognitive neuroscience, identification of fundamental cognitive and neurological processes associated with music requires ascertaining that such processes are demonstrated by listeners from a broad range of cultural backgrounds and in relation to various musics across cultural traditions. This chapter will review current research regarding the role of enculturation in music perception and cognition and the degree to which cultural influences are reflected in brain function. Exploring music cognition from the standpoint of culture will lead to a better understanding of the core processes underlying perception and how those processes give rise to the world's diversity of music forms and expressions.},

An increasing number of studies in the field of motor control have used TMS to gain an understanding of the different aspects of stroke cortical physiology and motor recovery. This review addresses the effects of corticospinal tract (CST) lesions in humans and nonhuman primates on the functional organization of the motor system. We review information on the physiological mechanisms by which the CST contributes to normal motor control and to central nervous system reorganization following stroke when the CST is injured as measured using TMS.

In mammals, the mental operations generating this ability are called executive functions and are associated with the prefrontal cortex. The corresponding structure in birds is the nidopallium caudolaterale. Anatomical, neurochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral studies show these structures to be highly similar. The avian forebrain displays no lamination that corresponds to the mammalian neocortex, hence lamination does not seem to be a requirement for higher cognitive functions. Because all other aspects of the neural architecture of the mammalian and the avian prefrontal areas are extremely comparable, the freedom to create different neural architectures that generate prefrontal functions seems to be very limited. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The auditory system must represent sounds with a wide range of statistical properties. One important property is the spectrotemporal contrast in the acoustic environment: the variation in sound pressure in each frequency band, relative to the mean pressure. We show that neurons in ferret auditory cortex rescale their gain to partially compensate for the spectrotemporal contrast of recent stimulation. When contrast is low, neurons increase their gain, becoming more sensitive to small changes in the stimulus, although the effectiveness of contrast gain control is reduced at low mean levels. Gain is primarily determined by contrast near each neuron's preferred frequency, but there is also a contribution from contrast in more distant frequency bands. Neural responses are modulated by contrast over timescales of ∼100 ms. By using contrast gain control to expand or compress the representation of its inputs, the auditory system may be seeking an efficient coding of natural sounds.},

Subjective reports of chills were accompanied by changes in heart rate, electromyogram, and respiration. As intensity of these chills increased, cerebral blood flow increases and decreases were observed in brain regions thought to be involved in reward/motivation, emotion, and arousal, including ventral striatum, midbrain, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex. These brain structures are known to be active in response to other euphoria-inducing stimuli, such as food, sex, and drugs of abuse. This finding links music with biologically relevant, survival-related stimuli via their common recruitment of brain circuitry involved in pleasure and reward.},

abstract = {Accurate timing is a critical aspect of motor control, yet the temporal structure of many mature behaviors emerges during learning from highly variable exploratory actions. How does a developing brain acquire the precise control of timing in behavioral sequences? To investigate the development of timing, we analyzed the songs of young juvenile zebra finches. These highly variable vocalizations, akin to human babbling, gradually develop into temporally stereotyped adult songs. We find that the durations of syllables and silences in juvenile singing are formed by a mixture of two distinct modes of timing: a random mode producing broadly distributed durations early in development, and a stereotyped mode underlying the gradual emergence of stereotyped durations. Using lesions, inactivations, and localized brain cooling, we investigated the roles of neural dynamics within two premotor cortical areas in the production of these temporal modes. We find that LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) is required specifically for the generation of the random mode of timing and that mild cooling of LMAN causes an increase in the durations produced by this mode. On the contrary, HVC (used as a proper name) is required specifically for producing the stereotyped mode of timing, and its cooling causes a slowing of all stereotyped components. These results show that two neural pathways contribute to the timing of juvenile songs and suggest an interesting organization in the forebrain, whereby different brain areas are specialized for the production of distinct forms of neural dynamics.},

Expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) has been used to map specific functions onto neuronal activity in different areas of the brain including the hippocampus (IEG imaging). Here we review IEG studies on hippocampal functional dissociations with a particular focus on the CA3 subregion. We first discuss the cellular functions of IEGs and the brain system interactions that govern their dynamic expression in hippocampal neurons to provide a more solid framework for interpreting the findings from IEG studies. We show the pitfalls and shortcomings of conventional IEG imaging studies and describe advanced methods using IEGs for imaging of neuronal activity or functional intervention. We review the current IEG evidence of hippocampal function, subregional-specific contribution to different stages of memory formation, systems consolidation, functional dissociation between memory and anxiety/behavioral inhibition along the septotemporal axis, and different neural network properties of hippocampal subregions. In total, IEG studies provide support for (1) the role of the hippocampus in spatial and contextual learning and memory, (2) its role in continuous encoding of ongoing experience, (3) septotemporal dissociations between memory and anxiety, and (4) a dynamic relationship between pattern separation and pattern completion in the CA3 subregion. In closing, we provide a framework for how cutting-edge IEG imaging and intervention techniques will likely contribute to better understanding of the specific functions of CA3 and other hippocampal subregions.},

abstract = {Heart failure (HF) patients show an inability to regulate autonomic functions, a characteristic which is associated with increased mortality. These autonomic deficits may stem from earlier demonstrated injury to central autonomic regulatory areas, providing a structural basis for the autonomic abnormalities. However, knowledge of structural injury provides insufficient insights into timing and magnitude of signal patterns within affected areas which lead to impaired autonomic outflow. Among damaged brain areas, cerebellar sites are key for timely coordination of sympathetic and parasympathetic attributes, and for dampening extremes of hypotension and hypertension induced by other injured sites, including hypothalamic and limbic areas. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in cerebellar and limbic areas to characterize amplitude and timing patterns of neural responses to the Valsalva maneuver, an autonomic challenge that elicits sequential sympathetic and parasympathetic responses, in 16 HF patients and 33 control subjects. HF patients showed distorted fMRI signal patterns during the challenge period in the cerebellar vermis, left cerebellar crus II, and left insula, whereas the right crus II and insula, and bilateral amygdalae showed normal patterns. However, all structures, except the left crus II, showed altered responses in HF during the recovery period. Crus II patterns reflected a failure of HF subjects to demonstrate the normal lateralized responses, while in the insula, HF subjects exhibited abnormal left-right patterns, relative to controls. The abnormal timing and response patterns in these injured areas critical for autonomic regulation likely contribute to the enhanced sympathetic outflow and autonomic dysfunction characteristic of HF.},

@article{Margoliash1997,
abstract = {This article reviews the organization of the forebrain nuclei of the avian song system. Particular emphasis is placed on recent physiologic recordings from awake behaving adult birds while they sing, call, and listen to broadcasts of acoustic stimuli. The neurons in the descending motor pathway (HVc and RA) are organized in a hierarchical arrangement of temporal units of song production, with HVc neurons representing syllables and RA neurons representing notes. The nuclei Uva and NIf, which are afferent to HVc, may help organize syllables into larger units of vocalization. HVc and RA are also active during production of all calls. The patterns of activity associated with calls differ between learned calls and those that are innately specified, and give insight into the interactions between the forebrain and midbrain during calling, as well as into the evolutionary origins of the song system. Neurons in Area X, the first part of the anterior forebrain pathway leading from HVc to RA, are also active during singing. Many HVc neurons are also auditory, exhibiting selectivity for learned acoustic parameters of the individual bird's own song (BOS). Similar auditory responses are also observed in RA and Area X in anesthetized birds. In contrast to HVc, however, auditory responses in RA are very weak or absent in awake birds under our experimental paradigm, but are uncovered when birds are anesthetized. Thus, the roles of both pathways beyond HVc in adult birds is under review. In particular, theories hypothesizing a role for the descending motor pathway (RA and below) in adult song perception do not appear to obtain. The data also suggest that the anterior forebrain pathway has a greater motor role than previously considered. We suggest that a major role of the anterior forebrain pathway is to resolve the timing mismatch between motor program readout and sensory feedback, thereby facilitating motor programming during birdsong learning. Pathways afferent to HVc may participate more in sensory acquisition and sensorimotor learning during song development than is commonly assumed.},

abstract = {Music, an abstract stimulus, can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal dopaminergic system. Using the neurochemical specificity of [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography scanning, combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system activity, we found endogenous dopamine release in the striatum at peak emotional arousal during music listening. To examine the time course of dopamine release, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with the same stimuli and listeners, and found a functional dissociation: the caudate was more involved during the anticipation and the nucleus accumbens was more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. These results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. Notably, the anticipation of an abstract reward can result in dopamine release in an anatomical pathway distinct from that associated with the peak pleasure itself. Our results help to explain why music is of such high value across all human societies.},

abstract = {The distribution of serotonin immunoreactivity in the rat cerebellum was studied using the indirect antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique of Sternberger. Furthermore, the origin of these chemically defined cerebellar afferents was studied using a procedure which combines the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with the PAP technique. Serotoninergic fibers and varicosities distribute throughout the cerebellar cortex. However, within the cortex there are density variations in the distribution of this indoleamine to the granule cell and molecular layers as well as differences in the spatial orientation of labeled elements, especially in the latter lamina. Serotonin-positive fibers are also present in the Purkinje cell layer. Some of the fibers pass from this layer into the overlying molecular layer while others form a plexus around the somata of Purkinje cells. Subsequent to injections of HRP into the vermis and immediately adjacent portions of the cerebellar cortex, several reticular and raphe nuclei (n.) were found to project to the cerebellum including the paramedian reticular nucleus, n. raphe pallidus, n. raphe obscurus, n. raphe magnus, n. reticularis gigantocellularis, n. reticularis paragigantocellularis, n. pontis oralis, n. reticularis tegmenti pontis and n. centralis superioris. Double-labeling experiments, however, reveal that the neurons giving rise to serotoninergic afferents to the cerebellum are located almost exclusively in the n. reticularis gigantocellularis, the n. reticularis paragigantocellularis and the n. pontis oralis. In conclusion, the findings of the present study further support the view that the cerebellar cortex is not uniform in its histological structure. Although serotoninergic elements are distributed throughout the cerebellar cortex, there are lobular variations in the laminar distribution of this indoleamine. These data suggest that serotonin may be exerting its physiological effect on different populations of cortical neurons in different lobules. Thus this putative neurotransmitter may play different roles in the circuitry of the cerebellum in disparate regions of the cortex. Further, the data obtained in the double-label experiments demonstrate a fairly restricted origin for serotoninergic afferents in the medullary and pontine reticular formation. Moreover, the majority are not located in the raphe nuclei.},

A modern revision of the avian anatomical nomenclature has now provided a common language for studying the function of the cortical-basal-ganglia-cortical loop, enabling neuroscientists to take advantage of the specialization of basal ganglia areas in various avian species. For instance, songbirds, which learn their vocal motor behavior using sensory feedback, have specialized a portion of their cortical-basal ganglia circuitry for song learning and production. This discrete circuit dedicated to a specific sensorimotor task could be especially tractable for elucidating the interwoven sensory, motor and reward signals carried by basal ganglia, and the function of these signals in task learning and execution.},

abstract = {Individual vocal recognition behaviors in songbirds provide an excellent framework for the investigation of comparative psychological and neurobiological mechanisms that support the perception and cognition of complex acoustic communication signals. To this end, the complex songs of European starlings have been studied extensively. Yet, several basic parameters of starling individual vocal recognition have not been assessed. Here we investigate the temporal extent of song information acquired by starlings during vocal recognition learning. We trained two groups of starlings using standard operant conditioning techniques to recognize several songs from two conspecific male singers. In the first experiment we tested their ability to maintain accurate recognition when presented with (1) random sequences of 1-12 motifs (stereotyped song components) drawn from the training songs, and (2) 0.1 - 12-s excerpts of continuous song drawn from the training songs. We found that song recognition improved monotonically as more vocal material is provided. In the second experiment, we systematically substituted continuous, varying length regions of white noise for portions of the training songs and again examined recognition accuracy. Recognition remained above chance levels for all noise substitutions tested (up to 91{\%} of the training stimulus) although all but the smallest substitutions led to some decrement in song recognition. Overall, above chance recognition could be obtained with surprisingly few motifs, short excerpts of song, and in the absence of large portions of the training songs. These results suggest that starlings acquire a representation of song during individual vocal recognition learning that is robust to perturbations and distributed broadly over large portions of these complex acoustic sequences.},

abstract = {When listening to music, we often spontaneously synchronize our body movements to a rhythm's beat (e.g. tapping our feet). The goals of this study were to determine how features of a rhythm such as metric structure, can facilitate motor responses, and to elucidate the neural correlates of these auditory-motor interactions using fMRI. Five variants of an isochronous rhythm were created by increasing the contrast in sound amplitude between accented and unaccented tones, progressively highlighting the rhythm's metric structure. Subjects tapped in synchrony to these rhythms, and as metric saliency increased across the five levels, louder tones evoked longer tap durations with concomitant increases in the BOLD response at auditory and dorsal premotor cortices. The functional connectivity between these regions was also modulated by the stimulus manipulation. These results show that metric organization, as manipulated via intensity accentuation, modulates motor behavior and neural responses in auditory and dorsal premotor cortex. Auditory-motor interactions may take place at these regions with the dorsal premotor cortex interfacing sensory cues with temporally organized movement.},

@article{Hardiman1996,
abstract = {Lesions of the cerebellum severely impair the classically conditioned nictitating membrane response (NMR) in rabbits. Thus, the cerebellum is essential for the production of conditioned responses (CRs), either because it is actively involved in NMR conditioning or because damage to it causes motor or other general deficits. To distinguish between these alternatives, the cerebellum may be inactivated during training. Inactivation of the cerebellum during acquisition training might result in the absence of CRs on initial trials of subsequent training without the neuronal blockade. The blockade may have prevented learning but it may have produced other deficits that require time or further training to overcome. This problem can be addressed by inactivating the cerebellum during extinction training. If inactivation during extinction training results in the immediate production of CRs when training is resumed without the blockade, then it may be concluded that extinction learning was prevented by the blockade-the presence of CRs argues against any deficits not associated with learning. We used muscimol to inactivate the cerebellum and test its involvement in acquisition and extinction of NMR conditioning in the same subjects. We injected muscimol close to the interpositus nucleus of the cerebellum 1 h before each of four daily training sessions of delay conditioning. Almost no CRs were produced in these training sessions-there was little or no acquisition of NMR conditioning during cerebellar inactivation. The subjects were then trained for four daily sessions without injections of muscimol. There were no CRs on initial trials of the first session of retraining, but all subjects produced CRs by the end of this session. The subjects then received four daily sessions of extinction training with muscimol inactivation of the nuclei-no CRs were produced. Extinction training then continued for four daily sessions without muscimol inactivation. On the first of these sessions, all subjects immediately produced high levels of CRs. These responses then extinguished within and between sessions with characteristic beginning-of-session spontaneous recovery. There was little or no extinction of NMR conditioning during cerebellar inactivation. After inactivation, the muscimol- inactivated subjects went on to acquire and extinguish NM responses at rates similar to those of appropriate controls. We conclude that cerebellar circuitry is essential for, and actively engaged in, both acquisition and extinction of this simple form of motor learning.},

We used Fos immunohistochemistry to quantify production of the immediate early gene protein product Fos (a molecular indicator of neuronal activity) in the brain correlated this expression with the variation in nesting behavior. Using this technique, we found that neural circuitry involved in motor sequencing, social behavior, reward and motivation were active during nesting. Within pairs of nesting birds, the number of times a male picked up or deposited nesting material and the amount of time a female spent in the nest explained the variation in Fos expression in the anterior motor pathway, social behavior network, and reward neural circuits. Identification of the brain regions that are involved in nesting enables us to begin studying the roles of motor sequencing, context, and reward in construction behavior at the neural level. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Humans often synchronize movements to the beat, indicating that motor areas may be involved in detecting or generating a beat. The basal ganglia have been shown to be preferentially activated by perception of rhythms with a regular beat (Grahn and Brett, 2007), but their necessity for beat-based rhythm processing has not been proven. Previous research has shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are impaired in timing of isochronous intervals (Harrington et al., 1998a; O'Boyle et al., 1996), but little work has tested more complex rhythms. In healthy volunteers, behavioural performance is better for rhythms with a beat than without a beat (Essens, 1986). We tested PD patients and controls on a rhythm discrimination task to determine if basal ganglia dysfunction results in an impairment of processing rhythms that have a beat. Unlike rhythm reproduction, discrimination has no motor requirements that are problematic for patients. Half the rhythms had a beat-based structure, and half did not. Subjects heard a rhythm twice and then indicated if a third presentation of the rhythm was the same or different. We predicted that PD patients would benefit less from beat structure than controls, resulting in a group by rhythm-type interaction, with reduced relative performance for the beat-based sequences in the PD group. Indeed this was the pattern of the results. In the control group, a significant advantage was observed for discrimination of rhythms with a beat compared to those without a beat. This advantage was greatly reduced in the PD group. Discrimination of beat-based rhythms was significantly impaired in PD patients compared to controls, whereas discrimination of non-beat-based rhythms did not differ significantly. This suggests that the basal ganglia are part of a system involved in detecting or generating an internal beat, and that this system is compromised in patients with Parkinson's disease.},

Open questions relate to whether timing relies on dedicated or intrinsic mechanisms and whether distinct mechanisms underlie timing across scales and modalities. Although experimental and theoretical studies support the notion that neural circuits are intrinsically capable of sensory timing on short scales, few general models of motor timing have been proposed. For one class of models, population clocks, it is proposed that time is encoded in the time-varying patterns of activity of a population of neurons. We argue that population clocks emerge from the internal dynamics of recurrently connected networks, are biologically realistic and account for many aspects of motor timing.},

abstract = {Associative learning in the cerebellum underlies motor memories and probably also cognitive associations. Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning, a widely used experimental model of such learning, depends on the cerebellum, but the memory locus within the cerebellum as well as the underlying mechanisms have remained controversial. To date, crucial information on how cerebellar Purkinje cells change their activity during learning has been ambiguous and contradictory, and there is no information at all about how they behave during extinction and reacquisition. We have now tracked the activity of single Purkinje cells with microelectrodes for up to 16 h in decerebrate ferrets during learning, extinction, and relearning. We demonstrate that paired peripheral forelimb and periocular stimulation, as well as paired direct stimulation of cerebellar afferent pathways (mossy and climbing fibers) consistently causes a gradual acquisition of an inhibitory response in Purkinje cell simple spike firing. This conditioned cell response has several properties that matches known features of the behavioral conditioned response. The response latency varies with the interstimulus interval, and the response maximum is adaptively timed to precede the unconditioned stimulus. Across training trials, it matches behavioral extinction to unpaired stimulation and also the substantial savings that occur when paired stimulation is reinstated. These data suggest that many of the basic behavioral phenomena in eyeblink conditioning can be explained at the level of the single Purkinje cell.},

To obtain insight into the changes introduced by artists, we compared Fourier power spectra in photographs of faces and in portraits by artists. Our analysis was restricted to a large set of monochrome or lightly colored portraits from various Western cultures and revealed a paradoxical result. Although face photographs are not scale-invariant, artists draw human faces with statistical properties that deviate from the face photographs and approximate the scale-invariant, fractal-like properties of complex natural scenes. This result cannot be explained by systematic differences in the complexity of patterns surrounding the faces or by reproduction artifacts. In particular, a moderate change in gamma gradation has little influence on the results. Moreover, the scale-invariant rendering of faces in artists' portraits was found to be independent of cultural variables, such as century of origin or artistic techniques. We suggest that artists have implicit knowledge of image statistics and prefer natural scene statistics (or some other rules associated with them) in their creations. Fractal-like statistics have been demonstrated previously in other forms of visual art and may be a general attribute of esthetic visual stimuli.},

In this review we examine reasons for this cultural separation, and show how recent findings from both areas fit a framework couched in terms of cognitive representation and control. These two broad factors have very different lifespan trajectories; consideration of their relative growth and decline makes it clear that cognitive aging is not simply 'development in reverse'.

abstract = {Calcium is a second messenger, which can trigger the modification of synaptic efficacy. We investigated the question of whether a differential rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) alone is sufficient to account for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of EPSPs in the basal dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex. Volume-averaged [Ca2+]i transients were measured in spines of the basal dendritic arbor for spike-timing-dependent plasticity induction protocols. The rise in [Ca2+]i was uncorrelated to the direction of the change in synaptic efficacy, because several pairing protocols evoked similar spine [Ca2+]i transients but resulted in either LTP or LTD. The sequence dependence of near-coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity on the direction of changes in synaptic strength suggested that LTP and LTD were induced by two processes, which were controlled separately by postsynaptic [Ca2+]i levels. Activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels before metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) resulted in the phospholipase C-dependent (PLC-dependent) synthesis of endocannabinoids, which acted as a retrograde messenger to induce LTD. LTP required a large [Ca2+]i transient evoked by NMDA receptor activation. Blocking mGluRs abolished the induction of LTD and uncovered the Ca2+-dependent induction of LTP. We conclude that the volume-averaged peak elevation of [Ca2+]i in spines of layer 2/3 pyramids determines the magnitude of long-term changes in synaptic efficacy. The direction of the change is controlled, however, via a mGluR-coupled signaling cascade. mGluRs act in conjunction with PLC as sequence-sensitive coincidence detectors when postsynaptic precede presynaptic action potentials to induce LTD. Thus presumably two different Ca2+ sensors in spines control the induction of spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide was identified as a biological intercellular messenger just over 20 years ago, and its presence and potential importance in the nervous system was immediately noted. With the cloning of NO synthase and the physiological NO receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase, a variety of histochemical methods quickly led to a rather complete picture of where NO is produced and acts in the nervous system. However, the details regarding the subcellular localization of NO synthase and the identity of its molecular binding partners require further clarification. Although the hypothesis that calcium influx via activation of NMDA receptors is a key trigger for NO production has proven very popular and led to suggested roles for NO in synaptic plasticity, there is little direct evidence to support this notion. Instead, studies from the peripheral nervous system indicate a key role for voltage-sensitive calcium channels in regulating NO synthase activity. A similar mechanism may also be important in central neurons, and it remains an important task to identify the precise sources of calcium regulating NO production in specific NO neurons.

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for the development of epilepsy, which can occur months to years after the insult. The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to the pathophysiological effects of TBI. Here, we determined whether there are long-term changes in inhibition in the dentate gyrus that could contribute to the progressive susceptibility to seizures after TBI. We used severe lateral-fluid percussion brain injury to induce TBI in rats. In this model, spontaneous seizure activity, which involves the hippocampus, appears after a long latent period, resembling the human condition. We demonstrate that synaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition is profoundly reduced in ipsilateral dentate granule cells 1 month after TBI. Moreover, synaptic inhibition decreases over time, and by 6 months after TBI, it is also significantly decreased contralaterally. Progressive loss of synaptic inhibition is paralleled by a decline in the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, but, in contrast to status epilepticus models, GABA(A) receptor subunit expression is largely unaltered. At both time points, the magnitude of tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents after TBI is maintained, indicating a preservation of the inhibitory constraint of granule cells through tonic inhibition. Our results extend the time window during which strategies to target epileptogenesis may be effective.},

abstract = {Catecholaminergic (CA) neurons innervate sensory areas and affect the processing of sensory signals. For example, in birds, CA fibers innervate the auditory pathway at each level, including the midbrain, thalamus, and forebrain. We have shown previously that in female European starlings, CA activity in the auditory forebrain can be enhanced by exposure to attractive male song for one week. It is not known, however, whether hearing song can initiate that activity more rapidly. Here, we exposed estrogen-primed, female white-throated sparrows to conspecific male song and looked for evidence of rapid synthesis of catecholamines in auditory areas. In one hemisphere of the brain, we used immunohistochemistry to detect the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in the CA synthetic pathway. We found that immunoreactivity for TH phosphorylated at serine 40 increased dramatically in the auditory forebrain, but not the auditory thalamus and midbrain, after 15 min of song exposure. In the other hemisphere, we used high pressure liquid chromatography to measure catecholamines and their metabolites. We found that two dopamine metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, increased in the auditory forebrain but not the auditory midbrain after 30 min of exposure to conspecific song. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to a behaviorally relevant auditory stimulus rapidly induces CA activity, which may play a role in auditory responses.},

abstract = {When a deviant (oddball) stimulus is presented within a series of otherwise identical (standard) stimuli, the duration of the oddball tends to be overestimated. Two experiments investigated factors affecting systematic distortions in the perceived duration of oddball stimuli. Both experiments used an auditory oddball paradigm where oddball tones varied in both their pitch distance from the pitch of a standard tone and their likelihood of occurrence. Experiment 1 revealed that (1) far-pitch oddballs were perceived to be longer than near-pitch oddballs, (2) effects of pitch distance were greater in low-likelihood conditions, and (3) oddballs in later serial positions were perceived to be longer than oddballs in earlier serial positions. The above effects held regardless of whether oddballs were higher or lower in pitch than the standard. Experiment 2 revealed a pattern of response times in an oddball detection task that generally paralleled the pattern of data observed in Experiment 1; across conditions, there was a negative correlation between detection times and perceived duration. Taken together, the results suggest that the observed effects of oddball pitch, likelihood, and position on perceived duration are at least partly driven by how quickly individuals are able to initiate timing the oddball following its onset. Implications for different theoretical accounts of the oddball effect are discussed.},

abstract = {The habenulae are evolutionarily conserved bilateral nuclei in the epithalamus that relay input from the forebrain to the ventral midbrain. In zebrafish, the habenulae display left-right (L/R) asymmetries in gene expression and axonal projections. The elaboration of habenular asymmetries requires the presence of a second asymmetric structure, the parapineal, the laterality of which is biased by unilateral Nodal signalling. Here we show that neurons are present earlier in the left habenula than in the right, but, in contrast to other habenular asymmetry phenotypes, this asymmetry in neurogenesis is not dependent on the parapineal. Embryos in which the L/R asymmetry in Nodal signalling is abolished display symmetric neurogenesis, revealing a requirement for this pathway in asymmetrically biasing neurogenesis. Our results provide evidence of a direct requirement for unilateral Nodal activity in establishing an asymmetry per se, rather than solely in biasing its laterality.},

The article comprises four parts, dealing with (1) conventional tapping studies, (2) other forms of moving in synchrony with external rhythms (including dance and nonhuman animals' synchronization abilities), (3) interpersonal synchronization (including musical ensemble performance), and (4) the neuroscience of SMS.

Two experiments with isochronous melodies showed that contour change and melodic repetition predicted judgments. For longer melodies in the 2nd experiment, variables predicted judgments best at the beginning of excerpts. The final experiment, with rhythmically varied melodies, showed that temporal accents, tempo, and contour change were the strongest predictors of meter. The authors' findings suggest that listeners combine multiple melodic and temporal features to perceive musical meter.},

We previously revealed that the habenula could be subdivided into medial and lateral subnuclei, and a prominent left-right difference in the size ratio of these subnuclei accounts for the asymmetry in its neural connectivity. In the present study, birth date analysis showed that neural precursors for the lateral subnuclei were born at earlier stages than those for the medial subnuclei. More neurons for the early-born lateral subnuclei were generated on the left side, while more neurons for the late-born medial subnuclei were generated on the right side. Genetic hyperactivation and repression of Notch signaling revealed that differential timing determines both specificity and asymmetry in the neurogenesis of neural precursors for the habenular subnuclei.},

abstract = {Songbirds communicate by learned vocalizations with concomitant changes in neurophysiological and genomic activities in discrete parts of the brain. Here, we tested a novel implementation of diffusive optical imaging (also known as diffuse optical imaging, DOI) for monitoring brain physiology associated with vocal signal perception. DOI noninvasively measures brain activity using red and near-infrared light delivered through optic fibers (optodes) resting on the scalp. DOI does not harm subjects, so it raises the possibility of repeatedly measuring brain activity and the effects of accumulated experience in the same subject over an entire life span, all while leaving tissue intact for further study. We developed a custom-made apparatus for interfacing optodes to the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) head using 3D modeling software and rapid prototyping technology, and applied it to record responses to presentations of birdsong in isoflurane-anesthetized zebra finches. We discovered a subtle but significant difference between the hemoglobin spectra of zebra finches and mammals which has a major impact in how hemodynamic responses are interpreted in the zebra finch. Our measured responses to birdsong playback were robust, highly repeatable, and readily observed in single trials. Responses were complex in shape and closely paralleled responses described in mammals. They were localized to the caudal medial portion of the brain, consistent with response localization from prior gene expression, electrophysiological, and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. These results define an approach for collecting neurophysiological data from songbirds that should be applicable to diverse species and adaptable for studies in awake behaving animals.},

abstract = {Zebra finches show a multifaceted response to playback of tape-recorded birdsong. A novel song induces an overt listening behavior, accompanied by a distinct electrophysiological signature and a wave of gene expression in the auditory telencephalon. With repetition of the same song these responses all habituate; habituation can persist for a day or more and is specific for the repeated song. This habituation is a form of selective memory. Here we describe four experiments to probe the nature of the information stored in that memory, using habituation of the genomic response as a physiological assay for stimulus recognition. Adult male zebra finches (awake and unrestrained) were exposed to repetitions of a test song to habituate the genomic response. The same song was then presented in one of four different contexts: (1) from a speaker on the opposite side of the cage; (2) at a reduced sound pressure level; (3) paired with constant illumination of colored lights next to the speaker; (4) paired with colored lights that were turned on and off in synchrony with each song bout. In all cases except the third, a "familiar" (habituated) song re-induced a new wave of gene expression in the auditory telencephalon when presented in the new context. These results reveal that memory for a specific song, as indicated by the initial gene habituation, incorporates more than just an acoustic description of the song. We suggest that habituation in the auditory telencephalon is controlled in part by an extrinsic system that allows detection of synchronous activity in different sensory or representational modalities.},

abstract = {Auditory information is critical for vocal imitation and other elements of social life in songbirds. In zebra finches, neural centers that are necessary for the acquisition and production of learned vocalizations are known, and they all respond to acoustic stimulation. However, the circuits by which conspecific auditory signals are perceived, processed, and stored in long-term memory have not been well documented. In particular, no evidence exists of direct connections between auditory and vocal motor pathways, and two newly identified centers for auditory processing, caudomedial neostriatum (Ncm) and caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale (cmHV), have no documented place among known auditory circuits. Our goal was to describe anatomically the auditory pathways in adult zebra finch males and, specifically, to show the projections by which Ncm and vocal motor centers may receive auditory input. By using injections of different kinds of neuroanatomical tracers (biotinylated dextran amines, rhodamine-linked dextran amines, biocytin, fluorogold, and rhodamine-linked latex beads), we have shown that, as in other avian groups, the neostriatal field L complex in caudal telencephalon is the primary forebrain relay for pathways originating in the auditory thalamus, i.e., the nucleus ovoidalis complex (Ov). In addition, Ncm and cmHV also receive input from the Ov complex. Ov has been broken down into two parts, the Ov ldquocorerdquo and ldquoshell,rdquo which project in parallel to different targets in the caudal telencephalon. Parts of the field L complex are connected among themselves and to Ncm, cmHV, and caudolateral HV (cIHV) through a complex web of largely reciprocal pathways. In addition, cIHV and parts of the field L complex project strongly to the ldquoshelfrdquo of neostriatum underneath the song control nucleus high vocal center (HVC) and to the ldquocuprdquo of archistriatum rostrodorsal to another song-control nucleus, the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA). We have documented two points at which the vocal motor pathway may pick up auditory signals: the HVC-shelf interface and a projection from cIHV to the nucleus interfacialis (NIf), which projects to HVC. These data represent the most complete survey to date of auditory pathways in the adult male zebra finch brain, and of their projections to motor stations of the song system. {\textcopyright} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Songbirds have unique value as a model for memory and learning. In their natural social life, they communicate through vocalizations that they must learn to produce and recognize. Song communication elicits abrupt changes in gene expression in regions of the forebrain responsible for song perception and production-what is the functional significance of this genomic response? For 20 years, the focus of research was on just a few genes [primarily ZENK, now known as egr1 (early gene response 1)]. Recently, however, DNA microarrays have been developed and applied to songbird behavioral research, and in 2010 the initial draft assembly of the zebra finch genome was published. Together, these new data reveal that the genomic involvement in song processing is far more complex than anticipated. The concepts of neurogenomic computation and biological embedding are introduced as frameworks for future research.

abstract = {Cognitive biases, which are defined as distortions in cognitive processes that are influenced by a background emotional state, can provide information about an individual's affective state. For instance, negative cognitive biases, where individuals assess ambiguous situations as unrewarding, are commonly found in humans suffering from anxiety disorders. Cognitive biases are also increasingly used as indicators of affective state in animals. As it is not clear whether female and male animals differ in performance on cognitive bias tasks, we used a spatial location task to examine cognitive bias in female and male adult Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). We trained the rats to distinguish between reward and unrewarded locations, and then provided food pots at ambiguous, intermediate positions. We found that, during testing, females were slowest to approach the unrewarded location, while they approached ambiguous and rewarded locations similarly quickly. In contrast, the males approached all locations quickly. This sex difference is consistent with previous evidence that male rats are quicker than females to extinguish previously learned associations. Cognitive bias tasks could therefore be used to examine sex differences in learning strategies, as well as providing opportunities to test predictions about sex differences in welfare requirements.},

abstract = {The caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) is an important site for the storage of auditory memories, particularly song, in passerines. In zebra finches, males sing and females do not, but females use song to choose mates. The extent to which the NCM is necessary for female mate choice is not well understood. To investigate the role of NCM in partner preferences, adult female zebra finches were bilaterally implanted with chronic cannulae directed at the NCM. Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, or saline (control) was infused into the NCM of females using a repeated measures design. Females were then tested in 3 separate paradigms: song preference, sexual partner preference, and pairing behavior/partner preference. We hypothesized that lidocaine would increase interactions with males by decreasing song discrimination and that this would be further evident in the song discrimination task. Indeed, females, when treated with lidocaine, had no preference for males singing unaltered song over males singing distorted song. These same females, when treated with saline, demonstrated a significant preference for males singing normal song. Furthermore, females affiliated with males more after receiving lidocaine than after receiving saline in the pairing paradigm, although neither treatment led to the formation of a partner preference. Our results support the hypothesis that NCM plays an important role not only in song discrimination, but also affiliation with a male.},

The definition of separate areas is based on the existence of tonotopic gradients in each single area and on differences in neural response behaviour between areas. The anatomical area L2a is functionally subdivided into two tonotopic centres. Other areas can be identified by anatomy and function. The borders vary slightly depending on the description method.},

ESS scores were significantly correlated with sleep latency measured during the multiple sleep latency test and during overnight polysomnography. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ESS scores were significantly correlated with the respiratory disturbance index and the minimum SaO2 recorded overnight.

abstract = {Zebra finches respond to certain auditory stimuli with the activation of the immediate early gene zenk. It has been shown that the amount of sound-mediated zenk gene expression varies in the zebra finch caudomedial neostriatum (NCM), apparently correlated with stimulus type (conspecific{\textgreater}heterospecific{\textgreater}noise{\textgreater}tones) and familiarity. Here we tested the impact of two additional factors-song-specific acoustical properties and testing conditions-on the specificity of the sound-mediated zenk response, as assessed by in situ hybridization. A variant of a normal conspecific song was first produced by randomizing the spectral content while retaining the amplitude envelope ('song-enveloped noise'). This stimulus and related controls were presented to birds which were either free in cages or restrained in a stereotaxic instrument, after isolation either overnight or for only 1 h prior to testing. We confirmed prior results that unrestrained birds show a greater zenk response to normal conspecific song than to other acoustic stimuli. However, under restraint, birds showed little or no selectivity for conspecific song compared to matched stimuli lacking a song organization. Thus the specificity of the zenk response to song is not determined simply by the acoustic structure and familiarity of the stimulus. We conclude that the intrinsic selectivity of sensory responses measured in the CNS may be influenced by factors associated with attention, arousal or vigilance, and may be significantly altered by experimental conditions that involve physical restraint.},

abstract = {Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been successfully applied for modulation of cortical excitability. tDCS is capable of inducing changes in neuronal membrane potentials in a polarity-dependent manner. When tDCS is of sufficient length, synaptically driven after-effects are induced. The mechanisms underlying these after-effects are largely unknown, and there is a compelling need for animal models to test the immediate effects and after-effects induced by tDCS in different cortical areas and evaluate the implications in complex cerebral processes. Here we show in behaving rabbits that tDCS applied over the somatosensory cortex modulates cortical processes consequent to localized stimulation of the whisker pad or of the corresponding area of the ventroposterior medial (VPM) thalamic nucleus. With longer stimulation periods, poststimulation effects were observed in the somatosensory cortex only after cathodal tDCS. Consistent with the polarity-specific effects, the acquisition of classical eyeblink conditioning was potentiated or depressed by the simultaneous application of anodal or cathodal tDCS, respectively, when stimulation of the whisker pad was used as conditioned stimulus, suggesting that tDCS modulates the sensory perception process necessary for associative learning. We also studied the putative mechanisms underlying immediate effects and after-effects of tDCS observed in the somatosensory cortex. Results when pairs of pulses applied to the thalamic VPM nucleus (mediating sensory input) during anodal and cathodal tDCS suggest that tDCS modifies thalamocortical synapses at presynaptic sites. Finally, we show that blocking the activation of adenosine A1 receptors prevents the long-term depression (LTD) evoked in the somatosensory cortex after cathodal tDCS.},

By directly recording TPCs in endolysosomes from wild-type and TPC double-knockout mice, here we show that, in contrast to previous conclusions, TPCs are in fact sodium-selective channels activated by PI(3,5)P(2) and are not activated by NAADP. Moreover, the primary endolysosomal ion is Na(+), not K(+), as had been previously assumed.

abstract = {The absence of fragile X mental retardation protein results in the fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common form of mental retardation associated with attention deficit, autistic behavior, and epileptic seizures. The phenotype of FXS is reproduced in fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) knockout (KO) mice that have region-specific altered expression of some gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor subunits. However, little is known about the characteristics of GABAergic inhibition in the subiculum of these animals. We employed patch-clamp recordings from subicular pyramidal cells in an in vitro slice preparation. In addition, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot experiments were performed on subiculum obtained from wild-type (WT) and KO mice. We found that tonic GABA(A) currents were downregulated in fmr1 KO compared with WT neurons, whereas no significant differences were observed in phasic GABA(A) currents. Molecular biology analysis revealed that the tonic GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha5 and delta were underexpressed in the fmr1 KO mouse subiculum compared with WT. Because the subiculum plays a role in both cognitive functions and epileptic disorders, we propose that altered tonic inhibition in this structure contributes to the behavioral deficits and epileptic activity seen in FXS patients. This conclusion is in line with evidence implicating tonic GABA(A) inhibition in learning and memory.},

abstract = {The ability to anticipate forthcoming events has clear evolutionary advantages, and predictive successes or failures often entail significant psychological and physiological consequences. In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong negative correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400-450 ms), (ii) beta band (14-30 Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity.},

abstract = {The R7 photoreceptor, a unique cell type within the Drosophila ommatidium, was initially proposed to be specified by two distinct signals from neighboring cells, one from the R8 photoreceptor and another from the R1/6 photoreceptor pair. The R8-to-R7 signal is the transmembrane ligand Bride of Sevenless (Boss), which is received by the receptor tyrosine kinase Sevenless (Sev) and transduced via Ras activation within the presumptive R7 cell. However, the identity of the R1/6-to-R7 signal has remained elusive. Here, we present evidence that the transmembrane ligand Delta (Dl), expressed by the R1/6 pair, activates the receptor Notch (N) in the presumptive R7 cell and constitutes the postulated R1/6-to-R7 signal required in combination with the Boss/Sev signal to specify the R7 fate.},

abstract = {Humans have a unique ability to coordinate their motor movements to an external auditory stimulus, as in music-induced foot tapping or dancing. This behavior currently engages the attention of scholars across a number of disciplines. However, very little is known about its earliest manifestations. The aim of the current research was to examine whether preverbal infants engage in rhythmic behavior to music. To this end, we carried out two experiments in which we tested 120 infants (aged 5-24 months). Infants were exposed to various excerpts of musical and rhythmic stimuli, including isochronous drumbeats. Control stimuli consisted of adult- and infant-directed speech. Infants' rhythmic movements were assessed by multiple methods involving manual coding from video excerpts and innovative 3D motion-capture technology. The results show that (i) infants engage in significantly more rhythmic movement to music and other rhythmically regular sounds than to speech; (ii) infants exhibit tempo flexibility to some extent (e.g., faster auditory tempo is associated with faster movement tempo); and (iii) the degree of rhythmic coordination with music is positively related to displays of positive affect. The findings are suggestive of a predisposition for rhythmic movement in response to music and other metrically regular sounds.},

abstract = {After its release from interneurons in the CNS, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is taken up by GABA transporters (GATs). The predominant neuronal GABA transporter GAT1 is localized in GABAergic axons and nerve terminals, where it is thought to influence GABAergic synaptic transmission, but the details of this regulation are unclear. To address this issue, we have generated a strain of GAT1-deficient mice. We observed a large increase in a tonic postsynaptic hippocampal GABAA receptor-mediated conductance. There was little or no change in the waveform or amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) or miniature IPSCs. In contrast, the frequency of quantal GABA release was one-third of wild type (WT), although the densities of GABAA receptors, GABAB receptors, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 kDa, and vesicular GAT were unaltered. The GAT1-deficient mice lacked a presynaptic GABAB receptor tone, present in WT mice, which reduces the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs. We conclude that GAT1 deficiency leads to enhanced extracellular GABA levels resulting in an overactivation of GABAA receptors responsible for a postsynaptic tonic conductance. Chronically elevated GABA levels also downregulate phasic GABA release and reduce presynaptic signaling via GABAB receptors thus causing an enhanced tonic and a diminished phasic inhibition.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, research has identified extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor populations that enable neurons to sense the low ambient GABA concentrations present in the extracellular space in order to generate a form of tonic inhibition not previously considered in studies of neuronal excitability. The importance of this tonic inhibition in regulating states of consciousness is highlighted by the fact that extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are believed to be key targets for anesthetics, sleep-promoting drugs, neurosteroids, and alcohol. The neurosteroid sensitivity of these extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs may explain their importance in stress-, ovarian cycle-, and pregnancy-related mood disorders. Moreover, disruptions in network dynamics associated with schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease may well involve alterations in the tonic GABA(A)R-mediated conductance. Extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs may therefore present a therapeutic target for treatment of these diseases, with the potential to enhance cognition and aid poststroke functional recovery.},

abstract = {Backgr: Digital pathology images are increasingly used both for diagnosis and research, because slide scanners are nowadays broadly available and because the quantitative study of these images yields new insights in systems biology. However, such virtual slides build up a technical challenge since the images occupy often several gigabytes and cannot be fully opened in a computer's memory. Moreover, there is no standard format. Therefore, most common open source tools such as ImageJ fail at treating them, and the others require expensive hardware while still being prohibitively slow. Res: We have developed several cross-platform open source software tools to overcome these limitations. The NDPITools provide a way to transform microscopy images initially in the loosely supported NDPI format into one or several standard TIFF files, and to create mosaics (division of huge images into small ones, with or without overlap) in various TIFF and JPEG formats. They can be driven through ImageJ plugins. The LargeTIFFTools achieve similar functionality for huge TIFF images which do not fit into RAM. We test the performance of these tools on several digital slides and compare them, when applicable, to standard software. A statistical study of the cells in a tissue sample from an oligodendroglioma was performed on an average laptop computer to demonstrate the efficiency of the tools. Concl: Our open source software enables dealing with huge images with standard software on average computers. Our tools are cross-platform, independent of proprietary libraries, and very modular, allowing them to be used in other open source projects. They have excellent performance in terms of execution speed and RAM requirements. They open promising perspectives both to the clinician who wants to study a single slide and to the research team or data centre who do image analysis of many slides on a computer cluster.},

abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) are part of extensive subcortico-cortical circuits that are involved in a variety of motor and non-motor cognitive functions. Accumulating evidence suggests that one specific function that engages the BG and associated cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry is temporal processing, i.e., the mechanisms that underlie the encoding, decoding and evaluation of temporal relations or temporal structure. In the current study we investigated the interplay of two processes that require precise representations of temporal structure, namely the perception of an auditory pacing signal and manual motor production by means of finger tapping in a sensorimotor synchronization task. Patients with focal lesions of the BG and healthy control participants were asked to align finger taps to tone sequences that either did or did not contain a tempo acceleration or tempo deceleration at a predefined position, and to continue tapping at the final tempo after the pacing sequence had ceased. Performance in this adaptive synchronization-continuation paradigm differed between the two groups. Selective damage to the BG affected the abilities to detect tempo changes and to perform attention-dependent error correction, particularly in response to tempo decelerations. An additional assessment of preferred spontaneous, i.e., unpaced but regular, production rates yielded more heterogeneous results in the patient group. Together these findings provide evidence for less efficient processing in the perception and the production of temporal structure in patients with focal BG lesions. The results also support the functional role of the BG system in attention-dependent temporal processing.},

abstract = {Genetic and environmental factors control morphological and functional differences between the two sides of the nervous system. Neural asymmetries are proposed to have important roles in circuit physiology, cognition and species-specific behaviours. We propose two fundamentally different mechanisms for encoding left-right asymmetry in neural circuits. In the first, asymmetric circuits share common components; in the second, there are unique unilateral structures. Research in both vertebrates and invertebrates is helping to reveal the mechanisms underlying the development of neural lateralization, but less is known about the function of circuit asymmetries. Technical advances in the coming years are likely to revolutionize our understanding of left-right asymmetry in the nervous system.},

abstract = {Sleep replay of awake experience in the cortex and hippocampus has been proposed to be involved in memory consolidation. However, whether temporally structured replay occurs in the cortex and whether the replay events in the two areas are related are unknown. Here we studied multicell spiking patterns in both the visual cortex and hippocampus during slow-wave sleep in rats. We found that spiking patterns not only in the cortex but also in the hippocampus were organized into frames, defined as periods of stepwise increase in neuronal population activity. The multicell firing sequences evoked by awake experience were replayed during these frames in both regions. Furthermore, replay events in the sensory cortex and hippocampus were coordinated to reflect the same experience. These results imply simultaneous reactivation of coherent memory traces in the cortex and hippocampus during sleep that may contribute to or reflect the result of the memory consolidation process.},

abstract = {Obligate avian brood parasites are raised by heterospecific hosts and, therefore, lack crucial early exposure to relatives and other conspecifics. Yet, young brood parasites readily recognize and affiliate with others of their own species upon independence. One solution to this social recognition paradox is the ontogenetic ` password' mechanism used by obligate parasitic brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), whereby conspecific identification is initially mediated through the cowbird chatter: a non-learned vocal cue. We explored the neural basis of such password-based species recognition in juvenile and adult male cowbirds. We found that cowbird auditory forebrain regions express greater densities of the protein product of the immediate-early gene ZENK in response to the password chatter call relative to control sounds of mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) coos. The chatter-selective induction of ZENK expression occurs in both the caudal medial nidopallium (NCM) and the caudal medial mesopallium (CMM) in adults, but only within the NCM in juveniles. In contrast, we discovered that juvenile cowbirds exhibit neural selectivity to presentations of either conspecific or heterospecific songs, but only in CMM and only after recent experience. Juvenile cowbirds that did not have previous experience with the song type they were exposed to during the test period exhibited significantly lower activity-dependent gene expression. Thus, in juvenile male cowbirds, there is early onset of species-specific selective neural representation of non-learned calls in NCM and recently experienced song in CMM. These results suggest that NCM is evolutionarily co-opted in parasitic cowbirds to selectively recognize the password chatter, allowing juvenile cowbirds to identify adult conspecifics and avoid mis-imprinting upon unrelated host species. These ontogenetic comparisons reveal novel insights into the neural basis of species recognition in brood parasitic species.},

abstract = {A previous paper (Herrnstein, 1958) reported how pigeons behave on a concurrent schedule under which they peck at either of two response-keys. The significant finding of this investigation was that the relative frequency of responding to each of the keys may be controlled within narrow limits by adjustments in an independent variable. In brief, the requirement for reinforcement in this procedure is the emission of a minimum number of pecks to each of the keys. The pigeon receives food when it completes the requirement on both keys. The frequency of responding to each key was a close approximation to the minimum requirement. The present experiment explores the relative frequency of responding further. In the earlier study it was shown that the output of behavior to each of two keys may be controlled by specific requirements of outputs. Now we are investigating output as a function of frequency of reinforcement. The earlier experiment may be considered a study of differential reinforcement; the present one, a study of strength of response. Both experiments are attempts to elucidate the properties of relative frequency of responding as a dependent variable.},

Although early research suggested that greater left than right frontal cortical activity was associated with positive affect, more recent research, primarily on anger, suggests that greater left than right frontal cortical activity is associated with approach motivation, which can be positive (e.g., enthusiasm) or negative in valence (e.g., anger). In addition to reviewing this research on anger, research on guilt, bipolar disorder, and various types of positive affect is reviewed with relation to their association with asymmetric frontal cortical activity. The reviewed research not only contributes to a more complete understanding of the emotive functions of asymmetric frontal cortical activity, but it also points to the importance of considering motivational direction as separate from affective valence in psychological models of emotional space.},

This learning-related change is referred to as conditioning-specific reflex modification (CRM) and is observed in the absence of the conditioned stimulus. The aim of the current study was to examine the sensitivity of the CRM paradigm to serotonergic manipulation with fluoxetine, a commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for anxiety disorders. To assess the effect of fluoxetine on exaggerated reflexive responding indicative of CRM and on conditioned cued fear, rabbits underwent delay NMR conditioning (pairings of tone and periorbital shock) and were tested for CRM, followed by 5 days of daily fluoxetine (0.03, 0.3, or 3.0 mg/kg) or saline injections. CRM was reassessed 1 day and 1 week later, followed by a retention test of conditioned responses (CRs) to the tone. Fluoxetine (3.0 mg/kg) enhanced CRM and retention of conditioned responses, a week after treatment ceased, and this is in agreement with the reports on increased anxiety-like behaviors in other animal models and humans. The CRM paradigm, therefore, may provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying the paradoxical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor effects.},

My hypothesis is that savants have privileged access to lower level, less-processed information, before it is packaged into holistic concepts and meaningful labels. Owing to a failure in top-down inhibition, they can tap into information that exists in all of our brains, but is normally beyond conscious awareness. This suggests why savant skills might arise spontaneously in otherwise normal people, and why such skills might be artificially induced by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. It also suggests why autistic savants are atypically literal with a tendency to concentrate more on the parts than on the whole and why this offers advantages for particular classes of problem solving, such as those that necessitate breaking cognitive mindsets. A strategy of building from the parts to the whole could form the basis for the so-called autistic genius. Unlike the healthy mind, which has inbuilt expectations of the world (internal order), the autistic mind must simplify the world by adopting strict routines (external order).},

abstract = {The Drosophila eye is a mosaic that results from the stochastic distribution of two ommatidial subtypes. Pale and yellow ommatidia can be distinguished by the expression of distinct rhodopsins and other pigments in their inner photoreceptors (R7 and R8), which are implicated in color vision. The pale subtype contains ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing Rh3 in R7 and blue-absorbing Rh5 in R8. The yellow subtype contains UV-absorbing Rh4 in R7 and green-absorbing Rh6 in R8. The exclusive expression of one rhodopsin per photoreceptor is a widespread phenomenon, although exceptions exist. The mechanisms leading to the exclusive expression or to co-expression of sensory receptors are currently not known. We describe a new class of ommatidia that co-express rh3 and rh4 in R7, but maintain normal exclusion between rh5 and rh6 in R8. These ommatidia, which are localized in the dorsal eye, result from the expansion of rh3 into the yellow-R7 subtype. Genes from the Iroquois Complex (Iro-C) are necessary and sufficient to induce co-expression in yR7. Iro-C genes allow photoreceptors to break the "one receptor-one neuron" rule, leading to a novel subtype of broad-spectrum UV- and green-sensitive ommatidia.},

These markers could be invaluable in studies that utilize the chick-quail chimaera system to investigate neural components of behavior. Therefore, we decided to clone avian homologs of immediate-early genes to allow an expression analysis in behavioral paradigms and to determine the degree of conservation among diverse species. We report in this study the cloning of the ZENK gene, an egr-1 homolog, from chicken, quail, zebrafinch, and canary. We show that the coding region of this gene is highly conserved and follows established phylogenetic relationships. In situ hybridization demonstrates that the expression pattern is also conserved among species. We further demonstrate that there are regions in the 3' untranslated area of the ZENK gene that are as highly conserved as the protein-coding region and that may play a role in postranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of ZENK gene expression.},

abstract = {Perceptual filters formed early in development provide an initial means of parsing the incoming auditory stream. However, these filters may not remain fixed, and may be updated by subsequent auditory input, such that, even in an adult organism, the auditory system undergoes plastic changes to achieve a more efficient representation of the recent auditory environment. Songbirds are an excellent model system for experimental studies of auditory phenomena due to many parallels between song learning in birds and language acquisition in humans. In the present study, we explored the effects of passive immersion in a novel heterospecific auditory environment on neural responses in caudo-medial neostriatum (NCM), a songbird auditory area similar to the secondary auditory cortex in mammals. In zebra finches, a well-studied species of songbirds, NCM responds selectively to conspecific songs and contains a neuronal memory for tutor and other familiar conspecific songs. Adult male zebra finches were randomly assigned to either a conspecific or heterospecific auditory environment. After 2, 4 or 9. days of exposure, subjects were presented with heterospecific and conspecific songs during awake electrophysiological recording. The neural response strength and rate of adaptation to the testing stimuli were recorded bilaterally. Controls exposed to conspecific environment sounds exhibited the normal pattern of hemispheric lateralization with higher absolute response strength and faster adaptation in the right hemisphere. The pattern of lateralization was fully reversed in birds exposed to heterospecific environment for 4 or 9. days and partially reversed in birds exposed to heterospecific environment for 2. days. Our results show that brief passive exposure to a novel category of sounds was sufficient to induce a gradual reorganization of the left and right secondary auditory cortices. These changes may reflect modification of perceptual filters to form a more efficient representation of auditory space.},

Previously we found that exercise increases the expression of certain neurotrophic factors including brain derived neurotrophic factor in the rat hippocampus. To further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes, we used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays containing probe sets representing approximately 5000 genes to analyze the level of gene transcripts in the hippocampus of rats voluntary running for 3 weeks in comparison with sedentary animals. An improved statistical approach for the analysis of DNA microarray data, Cyber-T, was utilized in data analysis. Here we show that exercise leads to changes in the level of a large number of gene transcripts, many of which are known to be associated with neuronal activity, synaptic structure, and neuronal plasticity. Our data indicate that exercise elicits a differential gene expression pattern with significant changes in genes of relevance for brain function. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science.},

abstract = {Humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. For example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by Gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. This superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. Various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. These models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. A review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. The neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. The hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [R.C. Miall, Neural Computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. By implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.},

abstract = {Interval timing in the seconds-to-minutes range is believed to underlie a variety of complex behaviors in humans and other animals. One of the more interesting problems in interval timing is trying to understand how the brain times events lasting for minutes with millisecond-based neural processes. Timing models proposing the use of coincidence-detection mechanisms (e.g., the detection of simultaneous activity across multiple neural inputs) appear to be the most compatible with known neural mechanisms. From an evolutionary perspective, coincidence detection of neuronal activity may be a fundamental mechanism of timing that is expressed across a wide variety of species. BioEssays 22:94-103, 2000.},

@article{Grahn2009e,
abstract = {Humans often synchronize movements to the beat, indicating that motor areas may be involved in detecting or generating a beat. The basal ganglia have been shown to be preferentially activated by perception of rhythms with a regular beat (Grahn and Brett, 2007), but their necessity for beat-based rhythm processing has not been proven. Previous research has shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are impaired in timing of isochronous intervals (Harrington et al., 1998a; O'Boyle et al., 1996), but little work has tested more complex rhythms. In healthy volunteers, behavioural performance is better for rhythms with a beat than without a beat (Essens, 1986). We tested PD patients and controls on a rhythm discrimination task to determine if basal ganglia dysfunction results in an impairment of processing rhythms that have a beat. Unlike rhythm reproduction, discrimination has no motor requirements that are problematic for patients. Half the rhythms had a beat-based structure, and half did not. Subjects heard a rhythm twice and then indicated if a third presentation of the rhythm was the same or different. We predicted that PD patients would benefit less from beat structure than controls, resulting in a group by rhythm-type interaction, with reduced relative performance for the beat-based sequences in the PD group. Indeed this was the pattern of the results. In the control group, a significant advantage was observed for discrimination of rhythms with a beat compared to those without a beat. This advantage was greatly reduced in the PD group. Discrimination of beat-based rhythms was significantly impaired in PD patients compared to controls, whereas discrimination of non-beat-based rhythms did not differ significantly. This suggests that the basal ganglia are part of a system involved in detecting or generating an internal beat, and that this system is compromised in patients with Parkinson's disease.},

On the other hand is the extensive literature suggesting that memory accurately preserves absolute features of experiences (Brooks, 1978; Jacoby, 1983; Medin {\&} Schaffer, 1978).

As with many psychological debates, there may be some degree of truth on both sides. Currently, philosophers of mind (Dennett, 1991) and cognitive scientists (Kosslyn, 1980) have also wondered to what extent our mental representations and memories of the world are perfect or accurate copies of experience, and to what extent distortions (or generalizations) intrude. {\textless}/m:italic{\textgreater}

Researchers have shown that people have little trouble recognizing melodies transposed in pitch (Attneave {\&} Olson, 1971; Dowling {\&} Bartlett, 1981), so it is clear that memory for musical melody must encode the abstract information, that is, the relation of successive pitches, or pattern of tones if not their actual location in pitch space. {\textless}/m:italic{\textgreater}

@article{Iversen2009a,
abstract = {Our perceptions are shaped by both extrinsic stimuli and intrinsic interpretation. The perceptual experience of a simple rhythm, for example, depends upon its metrical interpretation (where one hears the beat). Such interpretation can be altered at will, providing a model to study the interaction of endogenous and exogenous influences in the cognitive organization of perception. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we measured brain responses evoked by a repeating, rhythmically ambiguous phrase (two tones followed by a rest). In separate trials listeners were instructed to impose different metrical organizations on the rhythm by mentally placing the downbeat on either the first or the second tone. Since the stimulus was invariant, differences in brain activity between the two conditions should relate to endogenous metrical interpretation. Metrical interpretation influenced early evoked neural responses to tones, specifically in the upper beta range (20-30 Hz). Beta response was stronger (by 64{\%} on average) when a tone was imagined to be the beat, compared to when it was not. A second experiment established that the beta increase closely resembles that due to physical accents, and thus may represent the genesis of a subjective accent. The results demonstrate endogenous modulation of early auditory responses, and suggest a unique role for the beta band in linking of endogenous and exogenous processing. Given the suggested role of beta in motor processing and long-range intracortical coordination, it is hypothesized that the motor system influences metrical interpretation of sound, even in the absence of overt movement.},
