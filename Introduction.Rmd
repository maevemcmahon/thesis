#Introduction

Zebra finches are a well-established animal model for probing the molecular and neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying several forms of learning [@Zann1996]. Much of the past research has focused on highly specialised forms of learning during juvenile critical periods, especially male song learning [@Pfenning2012]. However, birds must continue to learn from daily experience even in adulthood. 

For this thesis, I develop and apply operant conditioning techniques to gain insight into the molecular and neural mechanisms that allow zebra finches to form and maintain different associations with specific songs they hear in adulthood. In this introduction, I begin by reviewing classical models of learning mechanisms in the zebra finch, including male song copying/learning, habituation, and female preference. I then describe the use of operant conditioning to study adult learning across multiple species. I continue by reviewing the use of immediate early genes (IEGs) to probe neural activity patterns during and after learning, and discuss literature suggesting that IEGs may be involved in the acute storage of salient information and in the long-term maintenance of memories. I then lay out the questions that I will address in this thesis.

##Classical models of learning mechanisms in zebra finches and other songbirds

###The zebra finch as a model species for vocal learning and auditory communication
Songbirds (oscines of Order Passeriformes) provide a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms that underlie communication through learned vocalisations --- an ability lacking in more familiar laboratory animals like the mouse (_Mus musculus_). Among the thousands of songbird species, the zebra finch (_Taeniopygia guttata_) has emerged as the primary focus for laboratory based studies [@Zann1996], in part because it is hardy in captivity, breeds rapidly, and has been domesticated over the past 50-100 years [@Griffith2017; @Olson2014]. Reflecting its primary status as an emerging model organism, the zebra finch was the second avian spcies (after the chicken) chosen for whole genome sequencing [@Warren2010].

###Song copying in the juvenile male zebra finch
The behaviour and neurobiology of zebra finch song learning has been investigated by a long line of researchers starting with Immelmann [-@Immelmann1969]. Much of this research has focused on the process by which a juvenile male learns to produce a unique song, by approximately copying the song of one or more adult tutors [for some representative reviews of this large literature, see @Bolhuis2010; @Doupe1999; @Gobes2017; @Marler2000]. In brief, this learning process proceeds in two phases during a limited juvenile "critical period". During an initial sensitive/sensory phase, male zebra finches learn the sound of a "tutor song", which they will learn to reproduce through practice during a subsequent sensory-motor phase. These two phases overlap, but once the sensory phase ends, around 65 days post hatch, normally reared juvenile male zebra finches will not learn new songs. The neural circuitry responsible for male song production has been worked out in considerable detail, and involves a network of discrete, interconnected, sexually dimorphic brain nuclei that are unique to songbirds [reviewed in @Bolhuis2006; @Doupe2005; @Mooney2009a]. A caudal descending sensorimotor pathway from HVC (used as a proper name) to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) controls the motor production of song by driving activity in the tracheosyringeal portion of the hypoglossal nucleus (nXIIts), which controls the syrinx. An anterior pathway from HVC through the striatum, to the thalamus, and back to HVC via the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (lMAN) is necessary for producing variability during juvenile song learning [@Marler2000], which enables the bird to produce increasingly accurate copies of the tutor's song during the sensory-motor phase [@Goldberg2012]; lesioning this pathway in adulthood, once the song has crystallised, has little effect on the song structure [@Brainard2004].

In terms of behaviour, research has been conducted into factors including the accuracy and precision of learning [@Brumm2009] and the role of the song tutor [@Clayton1987; @Williams1990]. These factors have also been assessed in a neurobiological framework; for example, though brood size has an effect on the accuracy of song learning, it does not correlate with the volume of brain regions involved in song production [@Gil2006]. In contrast, the accuracy of song copying may be reflected in brain activity in song production brain regions [@Bolhuis2012].

###Habituation to song presentation in adult zebra finches
Both male song production and female song preference are rooted during juvenile development, but the zebra finch has also served as a model species for a form of learning that continues through the lifespan: habituation [@Dong2009]. Habituation is a form of non-associative learning whereby repeated presentation of a stimulus leads to a reduced response to that stimulus [@Schmid2015]. Habituation to song playbacks has been studied in wild songbirds such as white-crowned sparrows [@Verner1971] and great tits [@Krebs1976]. In those studies, behaviours that indicate a response to the song, such as aggressive attacks and vocalisations, were measured and shown to reduce upon repeated song presentation. In the lab, neuromolecular correlates of behavioural habituation have been measured in the zebra finch, improving our understanding of the genomic and neuroanatomical underpinnings of habituation to auditory stimuli [@Mello1992; @Mello1994]. This will be further discussed in the framework of IEG research in Section 1.3.

###Song perception in both sexes
Only male zebra finches learn to sing. However, both sexes produce other unlearned vocalisations, and both sexes attend to and discriminate individuals based on their vocalisations [@Riebel2002; @Riebel2003]. Female song perception and male song production share similarities, including that both are driven by early life experiences [@Clayton1988; @Eales1985; @Holveck2014; @Lauay2004; @Louder2018]. The development of song preferences in females is a process sometimes placed in an imprinting framework [@Bischof1994; @Clayton1987; @Riebel2003]. Though male song production has been studied more extensively than female song perception, female preference for male songs may be a key driver in male song production [@Carouso-Peck2019]. Adult females prefer louder songs [@Ritschard2010] and directed rather than undirected songs [@Woolley2008]. Female song preference has been hypothesised to be driven by the quality of male song, which reflects the early developmental conditions of the male, and therefore male quality [@Holveck2008]. Though male song quality is driven by the developmental conditions of the male, early developmental stress does not appear to affect female song preference [@Woodgate2011]. Despite the recent research into female song preference, little remains known about whether song preference can be modified during adulthood.

Beginning with the discovery of the _ZENK_ gene response to song playbacks [@Mello1992], the neural circuitry involved in song perception has been gradually worked out [@Mello2004]. For both males and females, auditory input arrives in the MLd (dorsal lateral nucleus of the mesencephalon) in the brainstem, where there is some preliminary tuning of neural responses (e.g. functional MRI evidence suggests greater activation in response to conspecific song than heterospecific song in the male zebra finch left MLd [@Poirier2009] (\autoref{fig-introneuroanatomy}). The MLd projects to the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov), which projects auditory information to be filtered through Field L, a collection of tonotopically organised regions similar to the mammalian auditory cortex [@Gehr1999]. Field L projects to CLM (caudolateral mesopallium) and NCM (caudomedial nidopallium), which in turn project to CMM (caudomedial mesopallium) [@Moorman2011; @Vates1996]. The part of the brain that includes NCM, CMM, and Field L2 has been referred to as the auditory forebrain [@Theunissen2004]. Regions in the auditory forebrain then project to HVC and RA, which are part of the song production system in male zebra finches.

```

Connectivity between regions in the auditory forebrain is rich and complex [@Vates1996]. Field L2 has reciprocal projections to CLM, which has reciprocal projections to CMM, which has reciprocal projections to NCM. Despite the interconnectivity within the auditory forebrain, different regions, and even subregions, display vastly different responses to auditory stimuli. For example, some neurons in Field L and CMM selectively respond to conspecific songs, but other neurons selectively respond to white noise [@Grace2002]. Further, medial parts of Field L and CMM exhibit greater selectivity for conspecific songs than lateral parts [@Grace2002]. In contrast to the similarity of electrophysiological responses in Field L and CMM in that particular study, Mello et al. [-@Mello1992] found that in response to conspecific song playback, an immediate-early gene called _ZENK_ is expressed in NCM and CMM, but not in Field L2. NCM and CMM also show differential responses to song playback; _ZENK_ expression in female zebra finch NCM is higher in response to conspecific song than heterospecific song, but _ZENK_ expression in CMM is similar in response to both conspecific and heterospecific song [@Bailey2002].

In sum, evidence suggests that circuits involving NCM and CMM in particular are involved in generating higher-order representations of complex, salient songs. However, the details of those representations and the mechanisms by which they are generated, stored and recalled remain unknown. One of the aims of this thesis will be to seek evidence that representational activity patterns may shift according to the context in which those songs are experienced.

##Use of operant conditioning to study adult learning and perception
Operant conditioning is a form of associative learning whereby behaviour is altered by experience; effectively, it is the form of learning that leads to habit formation [@Staddon2003]. In contrast to classical conditioning, another form of associative learning, where a stimulus is associated with an outcome, operant conditioning creates an association between a behaviour and an outcome [@Kirsch2004]. Early studies demonstrated that random behaviours can be shaped by the regular presentation of rewarding feedback and highlighted that pattern-seeking is fundamental to learning processes [@Skinner1948]. The earliest work into operant conditioning focused on fundamental variables such as trial timing [@Skinner1938] and the relationship between reward frequency and the conditioned behaviour [@Herrnstein1961]. However, the role of complex neural processes, such as choice [@Washburn1991] and motivation [@Lawrence1989], in operant responding has also been investigated. As much of the early work into operant conditioning was conducted on pigeons [@Brown1968], a wide array of operant conditioning paradigms, such as the 2-alternative forced choice task and Go/No-Go, have been developed and extended for use in understanding bird behaviour [@Hulse1995].

Go/No-Go training is a form of conditioning whereby an animal learns to associate one stimulus with a positive reinforcement and a second stimulus with a positive punishment [@Evans1970]. It does this by way of operant conditioning; i.e. it learns to associate a behaviour with a stimulus, which is associated with a reinforcement or punishment. More simply, the animal is presented with two stimuli (the Go stimulus and No-Go stimulus) and must learn that when it encounters the Go stimulus it must make the Go behaviour (e.g. pecking at a sensor). If it does so, the Go behaviour is reinforced (with, for example, a food reward). If it does not do so, the animal does not receive any reinforcement. However, when the animal encounters the No-Go stimulus it must make the No-Go behaviour (i.e. withholding the Go response, or simply not responding). If the animal makes the Go behaviour in response to the No-Go stimulus, the behaviour is punished (with, for example, the lights going out). If the animal makes the No-Go behaviour in response to the No-Go stimulus, the response is neither reinforced nor punished. In this way, the bird learns to associate the Go stimulus with a Go behaviour and a reinforcement, and also learns to associate the No-Go stimulus with a No-Go behaviour and a punishment. This learning of differential associations is often characterised as discrimination learning [@Rose2012].

###Operant conditioning in songbird research
Operant conditioning has been used as a tool in many bird studies to assess perceptual abilities. For example, just-noticeable differences in harmonics and the effect of duration on similarity comparisons can be derived simply from patterns of responses [@Beckers2003; @Lohr1998]. One common assay is to test how birds generalise to novel stimuli once learning the discrimination of the initial training stimuli. For example, recent investigations have highlighted that starlings do not generalise tonal sequences when the pitch and timbre are altered [@Bregman2016] and that individual zebra finches use different tactics to learn artificial grammar rules [@VanHeijningen2013]. Though these reports use different forms of operant conditioning (e.g. 2-alternative forced choice, Go/No-Go), what they have in common is the quantification of responses to novel/unconditioned stimuli, and an assumption that those responses reflect whether the subjects perceive the unconditioned stimuli as more like one or the other of the conditioned stimuli. These studies often fail to recognise that an inherent bias in responding (such as an overall likelihood to make the Go behaviour in response to all stimuli) can affect the statistical outcomes, especially when reporting response probabilities. Evidence that Bengalese finches employ multiple cognitive tactics to learn the Go/No-Go discrimination further complicates these analyses [@Morisaka2009]

In contrast, I will use Go/No-Go operant conditioning solely as a tool to train the birds to associate one song with reward (dependent on a pecking behaviour) and the other with punishment (if pecking behaviour is not suppressed). Although evidence suggests that some songbirds may preferentially learn to recognise the No-Go stimulus [@Morisaka2009], and a range of human-based studies suggest that the Go and the No-Go responses are inherently unbalanced and require different cognitive processes [@Roy2009; but see @Criaud2013], I suggest that the clear differential responses to Go and No-Go stimuli (i.e. the Go and No-Go behaviour) indicate that some form of associative learning has occurred. 

It is also worth noting that many previous studies into associative learning of previously novel songs involved training male zebra finches [@Gentner2003; @Gentner2004; @Jarvis1995a]. However, testing song perception using male zebra finches risks confounding perception of the target stimulus with perception of bird's own song (BOS) [@Pytte1999; @Woolley2010]. Though female zebra finches' preference for father's song influences conspecific song preference [@Terpstra2006], it does not involve reciprocal connectivity between song production and song perception pathways, thereby simplifying interpretation of behavioural and neuroanatomical findings. For these reasons, in the operant training experiments described in this thesis, I have chosen to use female zebra finches.

##Use of ZENK to probe neural activity patterns during and after learning
IEGs are genes that respond rapidly to stimuli and have a broad range of downstream effects, and have been widely used in neuroscience to measure activity and learning in the brain [@Clayton2000; @Minatohara2016]. IEG expression can be measured using _in situ_ hybridisation, a method that provides extremely fine spatial resolution. In contrast to electrophysiology, which also provides high spatial resolution, _in situ_ hybridisation supports the imaging of large areas of tissue. (_In situ_ hybridisation suffers from low temporal resolution, and when studying neural tissue, only one time-point per animal can be assessed). The first application of IEGs to songbird research yielded the initial identification of brain areas specifically and selectively activated by the sound of birdsong, i.e. NCM and CMM [@Mello1992]. This study also made use of a gene known in songbirds as _ZENK_, the avian homologue of and an acronym for _zif268_, _egr-1_, _NGFI-A_, and _Krox24_ [@Mello1992]. (Note that NCBI has standardised the use of _egr-1_, I will refer to the gene here as _ZENK_ due to its longstanding use in the avian literature.)

The initial discovery was that conspecific songs elicit strong _ZENK_ expression in NCM and CMM and this peaks 30 minutes after acute playback of the song [@Mello1992; @Mello1994]. Within the auditory forebrain, expression of _ZENK_ was shown to correlate strongly with electrophysiologically measured activity in response to songs [@Chew1995a; @Chew1996; @Stripling1997]. The _ZENK_ response is also likely to occur in natural settings: only 10 repetitions of a conspecific song are necessary to induce the full _ZENK_ response [@Kruse2000], it can be induced in wild birds listening to acute playbacks [@Jarvis1997a], and _ZENK_ expression is higher across the auditory forebrain for birds in an aviary compared to birds isolated in a sound attenuation chamber [@George2016].

 _ZENK_ expression in NCM and CMM varies depending on the salience of features, making it especially useful for probing how the salience or significance of a particular stimulus may be represented in neural activity patterns. For instance, _ZENK_ expression is, on the whole, greater in response to conspecific songs than heterospecific songs, and greater in response to heterospecific songs than tones or silence [@Mello1992].  Additionally, the _ZENK_ response in NCM and CMM habituates to repeated song playback [@Mello1995]. This effect is song-specific; if played a novel song, the _ZENK_ response in the auditory forebrain recovers [@Mello1995]. Further, this recovery from habituation can occur with the same song played in a new context, such as from a different perceived spatial location [@Kruse2004].  Whether the stimulus is conspecific or heterospecific [@Beckers2003], novelty [@Horstmann2016], and perceived spatial location [@Hall2003] are all examples of varying levels of perceptual salience, and there is ample evidence that the _ZENK_ response in the auditory forebrain encodes this. 
 
 Other IEGs, such as _c-fos_, are regularly used as indicators of activity in songbird spatial memory studies [@Hall2014; @Mayer2010]. _c-fos_ has also been used in some auditory perception studies, and _c-fos_ and _ZENK_ sometimes display similar patterns of activation [@Monbureau2015], but _ZENK_ expression contrasts with other IEGs in multiple ways; for example, c-fos, but not ZENK, is induced in male zebra finch HVC in response to food aversion training [@Tokarev2011]. Additionally, developmentary trajectories for IEG expression in response to song playback may vary by sex [@Bailey2005]. Therefore, it is fruitful to select the IEG used in the greatest number of similar previous studies in order to minimise the number of extraneous variables and allow direct comparison to previous literature. To that end, the levels of the IEG _ZENK_ will be measured throughout this thesis.

###Role of the auditory forebrain in acoustic processing
Evidence from large-scale gene expression studies indicates that the auditory forebrain is involved in complex auditory processing. Within the auditory forebrain, at least five miRNAs vary depending on whether a bird has been exposed to a song or to silence [@Gunaratne2011]. One of these, miR-2954, affects the expression of around 1000 downstream mRNAs, suggesting that this single miRNA might mediate a large network of neurogenomic changes that are involved in song perception [@Lin2014]. Further, many of the genes affected by miR-2954 are downregulated when birds are exposed to song to which they have habituated [@Dong2009a]. Dong et al. (2009) found that detection of this habituation profile does not require presentation of the stimulus immediately before tissue collection; rather, simple exposure to repeated presentation of a single song can induce large-scale changes in gene expression the day before tissue collection. These broad dynamic shifts suggest that patterns of gene expression in the auditory forebrain contribute to, or at least reflect, recent exposure to song stimuli.

For some who study male song production, the auditory forebrain has been characterised as a secondary auditory processing centre that receives auditory input and feeds into the male songbird's song production system, and much work has been done to understand the processing of tutor song and bird's own song in the auditory forebrain [see @Mooney2009; @Theunissen2004]. However, the role of the auditory forebrain is more likely that of a general song processor for both males and females. For an overview of relevant studies into female preference for song stimuli, using IEG expression in the auditory forebrain, see (\autoref{tab-preference}). For example, for female zebra finches, who do not sing, temporary inactivation of NCM leads to females failing to show a preference for males singing natural song [@Tomaszycki2014]. NCM has been further implicated in the processing of sexually relevant stimuli for females; for female starlings, who prefer longer songs, @Gentner2000 found that _ZENK_ expression was higher in ventral NCM for females exposed to longer songs than females exposed to shorter songs, but that expression was uniform in response to both song lengths in CMM. In contrast, for female zebra finches, who prefer directed song to undirected song, _ZENK_ expression in NCM is modulated by familiarity of songs, whereas _ZENK_ expression in CMM is modulated by the directedness of the song as directed songs tend to be preferred over undirected songs [@Woolley2008]. Similarly, ZENK  expression in CMM is higher for female zebra finches who are exposed to their father's song than for birds exposed to novel songs [@Terpstra2006], and _ZENK_ expression in CMM is higher for female canaries who are exposed to sexy syllables compared to nonsexy syllables [@Leitner2005]. In one surprising study of natural and time-distorted songs played to female zebra finches, both NCM and CMM responded with similar increases in _ZENK_ expression in response to the time-distorted songs [@Lampen2014]. Therefore, for female songbirds, the auditory forebrain responds to birdsong in complex ways, with some aspects of preference, salience and familiarity leading to differential expression in NCM, and others leading to differential expression in CMM.

One potential explanation for the range of effects seen in the auditory forebrain is that subregions, which are not clearly visible using common neuroanatomical staining techniques such as hematoxylin and eosin, respond differentially. For example, _ZENK_ expression in response to song playback decreases from medial to lateral sections in NCM, but the same effect of laterality is not found for CMM [@Gentner2000]. Further, responses to auditory stimuli within the NCM vary on the dorsoventral axis; for canaries, dorsal NCM preferentially responds to low frequencies, and ventral NCM responds to high frequencies [@Ribeiro1998]. For the mesopallium, despite discrete nomenclature for CMM and CLM, these two regions are generally separated by their distance from the midline, and they do not respond similarly to all stimuli [@Jeanne2011]. Some reports collected data from CMM between 320-700 $\mu$m from the midline [@Woolley2008], and a frequently used zebra finch atlas shows CMM from 200-1700 $\mu$m from the midline [@zebraOnline]. Multiple studies provide no clear indication of laterality [e.g. @Jarvis1995a; @Lampen2014]. Given the complex multi-dimensional nature of responses to auditory stimuli in the auditory forebrain, there is a clear need for high spatial resolution, which modern methods, such as RNASeq and fMRI of the entire auditory forebrain, cannot provide.

###Associative learning in the auditory forebrain
Features that alter motivational salience, or salience that has been learned through repeated association [@Puglisi-Allegra2012], are also reflected in the _ZENK_ response (\autoref{tab-auditoryforebrainstudies}). This is in line with previous evidence suggesting that both perceptual and motivational salience predict the rate of associative learning [@Trevino2016]. Stimuli with no differences in perceptual salience, but that have been associated with a stimulus with perceptual salience, vary in the levels of _ZENK_ they induce. Jarvis et al. [-@Jarvis1995a] found that, using a classical conditioning methodology, _ZENK_ expression in NCM and CMM is greater when a song is paired with a shock than when songs and shocks are played/given at the same rate but unpaired. For starlings, Gentner et al. [-@Gentner2004] argue that novel songs elicit high levels of ZENK protein induction in NCM, whereas songs that birds have been trained to associate with a food reward or darkness punishment elicit similarly low levels as silence of ZENK in NCM. In contrast, in CMM, they found that the novel condition elicited the highest density of ZENK, followed by the trained songs, with silence significantly lower than novel and trained songs [@Gentner2004]. This study confounded stress and associative learning, and as the _ZENK_ response can be altered by placing a bird under stress [@Park2002], the findings are difficult to interpret. However, it is clear that subregions of the auditory forebrain respond in complex ways to auditory stimuli with learned associations.

Electrophysiological studies have also aided our understanding of the role of the auditory forebrain in associative auditory learning. In Gentner & Margoliash [-@Gentner2003], electrophysiological recordings of anaesthetised starlings' CMM demonstrated that CMM neurons respond more to songs that have been associated with reward than to songs that have been associated with punishment. They also found a greater neural response to songs associated with punishment than to novel songs [NB: in direct contrast to @Gentner2004]. A more recent study has shown that after learning to associate one song with a reward and another song with a punishment, neurons in awake birds' NCM responded more to rewarded songs than punished songs, with novel songs eliciting middling responses [@Bell2015]. In CMM, neurons were most responsive to rewarded songs, less responsive to punished songs, with novel songs eliciting a very low level of responding [@Bell2015]. Bell et al. (2015) therefore replicated Gentner & Margoliash's (2004) finding that CMM preferentially responds to stimuli that have been intensely trained to be associated with a reward or punishment.

Despite this wealth of both gene expression and electrophysiological investigations into associative learning in the auditory forebrain, no studies have yet controlled the song stimulus experience tightly enough to determine if gene expression is related to the stimulus’ association. To do so, birds must be trained to associate two song stimuli with two different conditioned stimuli, and the presentation of the song stimulus, to which the _ZENK_ response is measured, must come after confirmation that the birds have learned the associations.

##Aims and objectives
Throughout this thesis, I aim to answer the following questions: 

1. Are there differences in the neuroanatomical patterns of activity, as revealed by _ZENK_, when birds hear Go versus No-Go conditioned stimuli? That is, can we gain insight into the underlying neural and/or genomic architecture responsible for encoding memories?

2. Are there differences in how birds learn Go and No-Go stimuli, or is Go/No-Go operant conditioning a unitary task?

3. Are there differences in the gross motor behaviours displayed by birds when they passively hear previously conditioned Go and No-Go stimuli?

First, I will do this by combining molecular neurobiology with behavioural psychology to determine if differential IEG expression reflects memories of perceptual experiences. Go/No-Go operant conditioning provides us with a powerful method for forming associative memories. _In situ_ hybridisation of the IEG _ZENK_ allows the assessment of neural gene expression with high spatial resolution. I will train birds to discriminate between one song (Go stimulus) and a second song (No-Go stimulus). Then I will play one of those two songs immediately before collecting tissue for _ZENK_ _in situ_ hybridisation. I will use the pattern of _ZENK_ induction to assess which brain regions are involved in the perception of previously learned stimuli. 

Second, I will present Operanter, a new suite of hardware and software that allows us to inexpensively conduct avian auditory operant conditioning. I successfully developed, from the ground up, Java-based software and non-proprietary hardware that has enabled us to train 40 female zebra finches thus far.

Third, I will train a second set of birds using operant conditioning, and I will use a fine-grained analysis of operant conditioning learning and maintenance behaviours to characterise individual differences in Go/No-Go learning, and to better understand the processes underlying the Go and No-Go responses. 

Finally, I will train a third set of birds using operant conditioning, after which I will video record their behaviours in response to passive playback of either the Go or the No-Go song. I will use an array of statistical techniques to test if behaviours to passive playbacks might reflect, or even cause, changes in brain gene expression found during an allied study.
